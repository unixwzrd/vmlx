# 2026-06-10 - Release gate refresh after MiMo/N2 dev-app proofs

- Updated the canonical objective digest path from the stale N2 memory-only artifact to `build/current-objective-proof-after-mimo-n2-dev-app-proof-refresh-20260610.json`.
- The N2 Pro 397B objective row now lists the real current-source forced proof and real Electron dev-app proofs: `build/current-n2-jang1l-live-chat-cache-forced-after-gemma-video-20260610.json`, `build/current-real-ui-dev-app-n2-jang1l-bounded-chat-proof-20260610.json`, and `build/current-real-ui-dev-app-n2-jang1l-one-turn-visible-proof-20260610.json`.
- Regenerated `build/current-objective-proof-after-mimo-n2-dev-app-proof-refresh-20260610.json`, `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-mimo-n2-dev-app-proof-refresh-20260610.json`, and `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-mimo-n2-dev-app-proof-refresh-20260610.json`.
- Result: release gate remains red: manifest `current_proof_sweep=fail`, `prepackage_ready=false`, `release_ready=false`; checklist `status=open`, `failed_count=73`.
- Boundary: this is proof accounting and release-gate pointer repair only. No package, sign, notarize, tag, appcast, upload, or public release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - MiMo JANGTQ_2 dev-app exactness harness assertion

- Added optional exact assistant-content assertions to `panel/scripts/live-real-ui-model-proof.mjs`: `VMLINUX_REAL_UI_EXPECT_ASSISTANT_1` and `VMLINUX_REAL_UI_EXPECT_ASSISTANT_2`. The raw proof artifact now records the expected strings and fails directly on visible assistant mismatches.
- Ran current Electron dev-build MiMo V2.5 JANGTQ_2 exact-output proof with expected `ACK-CB-742` then `{"status":"ok","value":"blue-cat"}`.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-dev-app-mimo-v25-jangtq2-exact-output-harness-assert-proof-20260610.json` is `status=fail`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-dev-app-mimo-v25-jangtq2-exact-output-harness-assert-20260610-proof.json`.
- Positive evidence: real dev app launched, real `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/MiMo-V2.5-JANGTQ_2` loaded, two UI turns completed, server cache controls were visible, no raw parser/reasoning leak was recorded, native `mixed_swa_kv_v1` / `mimo_v2_asymmetric_swa` stayed active, paged cache hit on turn two, and block L2 wrote.
- Red evidence: first assistant mismatch `ACK-CB-742` -> `ACKCB-742`; second assistant mismatch `{"status":"ok","value":"blue-cat"}` -> `{"status":"ok","value":"blue"}`.
- Runtime/cache evidence: active memory `76482.7 MB`, peak `77012.3 MB`, `codec=turboquant_codebook`, `profile=JANGTQ_2`, prestacked routed experts `423`, `cache_hit_tokens=40`, `ram_tokens_cached=114`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=114`, `l2_tokens_on_disk=114`, block-disk writes `3`.
- Boundary: this strengthens the existing exactness blocker. Do not hide it with parser repair, JSON repair, sampling clamps, or cache changes; the next release-relevant action is artifact/logit/codebook/decode diagnosis or a replacement/lifted-precision artifact.

# 2026-06-10 - N2 JANG_1L dev-app one-turn visible-output boundary

- Added a scoped proof-harness switch `VMLINUX_REAL_UI_SECOND_TURN=0` in `panel/scripts/live-real-ui-model-proof.mjs`. It only disables the second UI message and relaxes only the two-turn/cache-hit assertions; it records `secondTurnEnabled=false` in proof artifacts and does not claim multi-turn/cache reuse.
- Ran current Electron dev-build Nex/N2 Pro JANG_1L one-turn Chat proof with `npm run dev`, Chat Completions, server cache controls, prompt `Reply with exactly N2_JANG1L_VISIBLE and no other text.`, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, max tokens `16`, and max prompt tokens `1024`.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-dev-app-n2-jang1l-one-turn-visible-proof-20260610.json` is `status=fail`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-dev-app-n2-jang1l-one-turn-visible-20260610-proof.json`.
- Positive evidence: dev app launched, real `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/Nex-N2-Pro-JANG_1L` loaded, one Chat Completions request completed without renderer send errors or Metal 503, qwen3_5_moe/JANG_1L autodetect selected qwen tool parser and qwen3 reasoning parser, native `hybrid_ssm_v1` initialized, attention-only live TurboQuant KV and SSM companion state were active, async rederive ran, paged cache and block L2 wrote, and SSM companion L2 stored state.
- Red evidence: the single assistant turn streamed `16` tokens but persisted empty visible content; stream trace went from one space to sixteen spaces, with no hidden reasoning or raw parser leak. This separates the first-turn whitespace decode/output blocker from the prior second-turn Metal working-set guard.
- Runtime/cache evidence: active memory `112550.2 MB`, peak `112807.4 MB`, `actual_bits=2.13`, `profile=JANG_1L`, prestacked routed experts `540`, 15 attention TQ-KV layers, 45 SSM companion layers, `ram_tokens_cached=19`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=19`, `l2_ssm_tokens_on_disk=19`, `l2_tokens_on_disk=38`, block-disk writes `1`, SSM companion disk store `1`, TTFT `46.44s`, decode `0.8 tok/s`.
- Boundary: this does not clear N2 JANG_1L visible quality, second-turn/cache reuse, tools, Responses, L2 restart, media, installed-app parity, package/sign/notarize, or release support. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - MiMo JANG_2L dev-app audio boundary

- Ran current Electron dev-build MiMo V2.5 JANG_2L audio proof with `npm run dev`, Chat Completions, one app audio attachment, server cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, max tokens `96`, and max prompt tokens `12000`.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-dev-app-mimo-v25-jang2l-audio-proof-20260610.json` is `status=fail`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-dev-app-mimo-v25-jang2l-audio-20260610-proof.json`.
- Positive evidence: dev app launched, real `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/MiMo-V2.5-JANG_2L` loaded, two visible text turns completed before audio, server `MEDIA_DIAG` saw one `input_audio` content part, server cache controls were visible, and no raw parser/reasoning leak was recorded.
- Red evidence: audio turn failed at `audio_send_message` with HTTP `400`: `/v1/chat/completions received unsupported media modality audio because the loaded runtime is text-only. Supported modalities: text.`
- Runtime/cache evidence before the audio guard: active memory `105016.1 MB`, peak `106151.0 MB`, `codec=affine_quantized_matmul`, `profile=JANG_2L_322_D3E16`, Metal NA eligible, native `mixed_swa_kv_v1` / `mimo_v2_asymmetric_swa`, generic TurboQuant KV correctly inactive, `ram_tokens_cached=110`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=110`, `l2_tokens_on_disk=110`, and block-disk writes `3`.
- Boundary: this classifies MiMo JANG_2L dev-app audio as honestly unsupported by the current text-only runtime despite preserved media metadata. It does not clear MiMo media support, installed-app parity, or release readiness. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - MiMo JANG_2L dev-app video boundary

- Ran current Electron dev-build MiMo V2.5 JANG_2L video proof with `npm run dev`, Chat Completions, one app video attachment, server cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, max tokens `96`, and max prompt tokens `12000`.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-dev-app-mimo-v25-jang2l-video-proof-20260610.json` is `status=fail`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-dev-app-mimo-v25-jang2l-video-20260610-proof.json`.
- Positive evidence: dev app launched, real `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/MiMo-V2.5-JANG_2L` loaded, two visible text turns completed before video, server `MEDIA_DIAG` saw one `video_url` content part, server cache controls were visible, and no raw parser/reasoning leak was recorded.
- Red evidence: video turn failed at `video_send_message` with HTTP `400`: `/v1/chat/completions received unsupported media modality video because the loaded runtime is text-only. Supported modalities: text.`
- Runtime/cache evidence before the video guard: active memory `105016.1 MB`, peak `106152.4 MB`, `codec=affine_quantized_matmul`, `profile=JANG_2L_322_D3E16`, Metal NA eligible, native `mixed_swa_kv_v1` / `mimo_v2_asymmetric_swa`, generic TurboQuant KV correctly inactive, `ram_tokens_cached=110`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=110`, `l2_tokens_on_disk=110`, and block-disk writes `3`.
- Boundary: this classifies MiMo JANG_2L dev-app video as honestly unsupported by the current text-only runtime despite preserved media metadata. It does not clear MiMo media support, installed-app parity, or release readiness. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - MiMo JANGTQ_2 dev-app audio boundary

- Ran current Electron dev-build MiMo V2.5 JANGTQ_2 audio proof with `npm run dev`, Chat Completions, one app audio attachment, server cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, max tokens `96`, and max prompt tokens `12000`.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-dev-app-mimo-v25-jangtq2-audio-proof-20260610.json` is `status=fail`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-dev-app-mimo-v25-jangtq2-audio-20260610-proof.json`.
- Positive evidence: dev app launched, real `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/MiMo-V2.5-JANGTQ_2` loaded, two visible text turns completed before audio, server `MEDIA_DIAG` saw one `input_audio` content part, server cache controls were visible, and no raw parser/reasoning leak was recorded.
- Red evidence: audio turn failed at `audio_send_message` with HTTP `400`: `/v1/chat/completions received unsupported media modality audio because the loaded runtime is text-only. Supported modalities: text.`
- Runtime/cache evidence before the audio guard: active memory `76491.8 MB`, peak `77127.3 MB`, `codec=turboquant_codebook`, `profile=JANGTQ_2`, prestacked routed experts `423`, native `mixed_swa_kv_v1` / `mimo_v2_asymmetric_swa`, generic TurboQuant KV correctly inactive, `ram_tokens_cached=132`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=132`, `l2_tokens_on_disk=132`, and block-disk writes `3`.
- Boundary: this classifies MiMo JANGTQ_2 dev-app audio as honestly unsupported by the current text-only runtime despite preserved media metadata. It does not clear MiMo media support, installed-app parity, exactness, or release readiness. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - MiMo JANGTQ_2 dev-app video boundary

- Ran current Electron dev-build MiMo V2.5 JANGTQ_2 video proof with `npm run dev`, Chat Completions, one app video attachment, server cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, max tokens `96`, and max prompt tokens `12000`.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-dev-app-mimo-v25-jangtq2-video-proof-20260610.json` is `status=fail`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-dev-app-mimo-v25-jangtq2-video-20260610-proof.json`.
- Positive evidence: dev app launched, real `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/MiMo-V2.5-JANGTQ_2` loaded, two visible text turns completed before video, server `MEDIA_DIAG` saw one `video_url` content part, server cache controls were visible, and no raw parser/reasoning leak was recorded.
- Red evidence: video turn failed at `video_send_message` with HTTP `400`: `/v1/chat/completions received unsupported media modality video because the loaded runtime is text-only. Supported modalities: text.`
- Runtime/cache evidence before the video guard: active memory `76491.8 MB`, peak `77127.3 MB`, `codec=turboquant_codebook`, `profile=JANGTQ_2`, prestacked routed experts `423`, native `mixed_swa_kv_v1` / `mimo_v2_asymmetric_swa`, generic TurboQuant KV correctly inactive, `ram_tokens_cached=132`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=132`, `l2_tokens_on_disk=132`, and block-disk writes `3`.
- Boundary: this classifies MiMo JANGTQ_2 dev-app video as honestly unsupported by the current text-only runtime despite preserved media metadata. It does not clear MiMo media support, installed-app parity, exactness, or release readiness. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - N2 JANG_1L dev-app bounded chat

- Ran current Electron dev-build Nex/N2 Pro JANG_1L bounded Chat proof with `npm run dev`, Chat Completions, server cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, max tokens `8`, and max prompt tokens `4096`.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-dev-app-n2-jang1l-bounded-chat-proof-20260610.json` is `status=fail`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-dev-app-n2-jang1l-bounded-chat-20260610-proof.json`.
- Proven: dev app launched, real `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/Nex-N2-Pro-JANG_1L` loaded, `/health` reached, first Chat Completions request returned HTTP `200`, qwen3_5_moe/JANG_1L detection was correct, qwen tool parser and qwen3 reasoning parser auto-selected, native `hybrid_ssm_v1` cache initialized, live attention TurboQuant KV active, SSM companion state active, async rederive ran, paged cache active, block L2 wrote, and SSM companion L2 stored state.
- Runtime/cache evidence: active memory `112548.8 MB`, peak `112803.4 MB`, `actual_bits=2.13`, `profile=JANG_1L`, `prestacked_switch=540`, `trained_active_experts=10`, 15 attention TQ-KV layers, 45 SSM companion layers, `ram_tokens_cached=18`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=18`, `l2_ssm_tokens_on_disk=18`, `l2_tokens_on_disk=36`, block-disk writes `1`, and SSM companion disk store `1`.
- Red evidence: first assistant visible content was empty/whitespace (`8` streamed space tokens), and the second UI turn failed with HTTP `503`: Metal GPU working set too full at `102%` of the `107.5GB` cap. This means real dev-app load + one bounded request is proven, but visible quality and multi-turn/cache reuse remain red.
- Boundary: this does not clear N2 JANG_1L tools, Responses, Responses stream, L2 restart, media, installed-app parity, public tunnel parity, package/sign/notarize/tag/upload, or release support. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - Gemma 31B JANG4M dev-app audio boundary

- Ran current Electron dev-build Gemma 4 31B QAT JANG4M audio proof with `npm run dev`, Chat Completions, one app audio attachment, server cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, max tokens `128`, and max prompt tokens `12000`.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-dev-app-gemma4-31b-jang4m-audio-proof-20260610.json` is `status=fail`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-dev-app-gemma4-31b-jang4m-audio-20260610-proof.json`.
- Positive evidence: dev app launched, real `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ-AI/gemma-4-31B-it-qat-JANG_4M` loaded, two visible text turns completed before audio, the app forced multimodal for one audio file, server `MEDIA_DIAG` saw one `input_audio` content part, server cache controls were visible, and no raw parser/reasoning leak was recorded.
- Red evidence: audio turn failed at `audio_send_message` with HTTP `400`: `/v1/chat/completions received unsupported media modality audio. Supported modalities: text, vision, video.`
- Runtime/cache evidence before the audio guard: active memory `25324.6 MB`, peak `25728.6 MB`, `weight_format=jang_affine`, `profile=JANG_4M`, Metal NA active, native `mixed_swa_kv_v1`, `cache_detail=paged+mixed_swa`, `cache_hit_tokens=20`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=62`, `l2_tokens_on_disk=62`, and block-disk writes `2`.
- Boundary: this classifies Gemma 31B JANG4M dev-app audio as honestly unsupported, not untested. It does not invalidate 31B text/tools/image/video/cache green rows, and it does not clear audio support, installed-app parity, public tunnel SSE, or release readiness. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - Gemma 26B JANG4M dev-app audio boundary

- Ran current Electron dev-build Gemma 4 26B A4B QAT JANG4M audio proof with `npm run dev`, Chat Completions, one app audio attachment, server cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, max tokens `128`, and max prompt tokens `12000`.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-dev-app-gemma4-26b-jang4m-audio-proof-20260610.json` is `status=fail`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-dev-app-gemma4-26b-jang4m-audio-20260610-proof.json`.
- Positive evidence: dev app launched, real `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ-AI/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-qat-JANG_4M` loaded, two visible text turns completed before audio, the app forced multimodal for one audio file, server `MEDIA_DIAG` saw one `input_audio` content part, server cache controls were visible, and no raw parser/reasoning leak was recorded.
- Red evidence: audio turn failed at `audio_send_message` with HTTP `400`: `/v1/chat/completions received unsupported media modality audio. Supported modalities: text, vision, video.`
- Runtime/cache evidence before the audio guard: active memory `17648.7 MB`, peak `17843.1 MB`, `weight_format=jang_affine`, `profile=JANG_4M`, Metal NA active, native `mixed_swa_kv_v1`, `cache_detail=paged+mixed_swa`, `cache_hit_tokens=20`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=64`, `l2_tokens_on_disk=64`, and block-disk writes `2`.
- Boundary: this classifies Gemma 26B JANG4M dev-app audio as honestly unsupported, not untested. It does not invalidate 26B text/tools/image/video/cache green rows, and it does not clear audio support, installed-app parity, public tunnel SSE, or release readiness. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - N2 JANG_1L forced live load after Gemma video

- Per Eric's direction, ran Nex/N2 Pro JANG_1L live gate anyway instead of stopping at the preflight skip. Command used `--jang1l-required-extra-headroom-gib 0`, low batches (`prefill=64`, `step=128`, `completion=32`), `ssm-state-cache-mb=128`, paged cache block size `64`, and block L2 max `2 GB`.
- Artifact `build/current-n2-jang1l-live-chat-cache-forced-after-gemma-video-20260610.json` is `status=fail`, but it proves a real load and one bounded request: server reached `/health`, model loaded as `qwen3_5_moe` JANG_1L, first Chat Completions request returned HTTP `200`, then cache-warm/cache-hit requests returned HTTP `503` from the Metal working-set guard at `102%` of the `107.5GB` cap.
- Runtime proof: `profile=JANG_1L`, `codec=affine_quantized_matmul`, `target_bits=1.0`, `actual_bits=2.13`, `prestacked_switch=540`, `trained_active_experts=10`, `n_routed_experts=512`, qwen parser, qwen3 reasoning parser, MTP metadata inconsistent because `jang_config.drop_mtp=true` while config declares one MTP layer and no MTP tensors.
- Cache proof: native `hybrid_ssm_v1`, `attention_kv + ssm_companion_state + async_rederive`, live attention TurboQuant KV enabled for 15 attention layers, companion SSM state full precision for 45 layers, q4 storage-boundary attention KV, paged cache, block L2, and SSM companion L2 initialized.
- Memory proof: before launch `114.03 GiB` available; after health `112.92 GiB`; after first request `6.41 GiB` available. Final health reported active Metal `112357.6 MB`, peak `112563.1 MB`, cache `0 MB`. Server exited cleanly after the harness terminated it; no model process remained.
- Boundary: this clears "can load and answer one bounded Chat request on this 128GB Mac" only. It does not clear cache warm/hit, tool, Responses, Responses stream, L2 restart, media, UI installed-app, or release support for N2 JANG_1L. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-09 - N2 JANG1L continuation preflight

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, no package/sign/notarize/tag/download release action.
- Reduced blocker class: `runtime/kernel` scheduling proof for Nex/N2 Pro 397B `JANG_1L`.
- No-load command: `.venv/bin/python tests/cross_matrix/run_n2_jang1l_memory_preflight.py --model /Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/Nex-N2-Pro-JANG_1L --out build/current-n2-pro-jang1l-local-memory-preflight-continuation-20260609.json`.
- Result: `decision=do_not_launch`; model/index/config/jang_config exist; `artifact_profile=JANG_1L`, `format=jang`, `model_type=qwen3_5_moe`, `architecture=Qwen3_5MoeForConditionalGeneration`.
- Memory math: indexed payload `110.57 GiB`, required extra Metal/runtime headroom `8.0 GiB`, required available `118.57 GiB`, current available `112.17 GiB`, gap `6.40 GiB`.
- Artifact weight map summary: `linear_attention_tensors=855`, `vision_tensors=333`, `expert_tensors=720`, `total_tensors=2845`.
- Boundary: no N2 weights were loaded. This is scheduling/artifact proof only, not live runtime/cache/API/UI release clearance. Do not lower the gate or force launch below the available-memory requirement.

# 2026-06-09 - Responses Qwen35 tunnel output-index classification

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, no package/sign/notarize/tag/download release action.
- Reduced blocker class: `api/ui` Responses raw-SSE parity for reasoning-enabled tool calls.
- Current-source trace: `stream_responses_api()` closes the streaming message item at `output_index=0`, appends it, increments `output_index`, then emits function_call items at the next index. The no-heavy contract still covers source empty XML required-arg fail-closed behavior, output-index ordering, gateway argument passthrough, and stale Responses port rejection.
- Artifact truth: `build/current-responses-raw-sse-parity-qwen35-tunnel-output-index-recapture-20260609.json` remains `status=fail`; the only present surface is public tunnel Qwen35, which preserves `record_fact` args `{"value": "blue-cat"}` and has `reasoning_events=10`, but emits `message=[0]` and `function_call=[0]`.
- Gemma same-model tunnel boundary: `build/current-responses-raw-sse-parity-direct-gateway-tunnel-gemma4-e2b-after-parser-20260609.json` remains `status=fail`; direct/gateway Gemma4 E2B preserve args and valid indices, but tunnel returns `model_not_found` because `gemma4-e2b-sse` is not advertised there.
- Classification: do not fix this by disabling reasoning, inventing missing arguments, or adding parser fallback injection. Next proof is Qwen35 current-source direct and panel-gateway raw SSE with the exact tunnel request/model. If those use function_call `output_index=1`, rebuild/redeploy the tunnel backend and recapture. If they duplicate `0`, reopen the source streaming finalization path.
- Boundary: Responses parity remains open for same-model direct/gateway/tunnel, deployed tunnel freshness, final object consistency, and tool-result continuation. No release action.

# 2026-06-09 - Gemma4 12B JANG4M no-media current proof pointer

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, no package/sign/notarize/tag/download release action.
- Reduced blocker class: Gemma4 12B JANG_4M source no-media tools/cache/L2 proof freshness.
- Live command: `VMLINUX_BENCH_ISOLATED=1 .venv/bin/python bench/all_local_model_smoke.py --models-root /Users/eric/models --only gemma-4-12B-it-JANG_4M --max-models 1 --include-tools --include-l2-restart --no-media --no-video --no-audio --port 8876 --load-timeout-s 600 --request-timeout-s 240 --out build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-12b-jang4m-tools-nomedia-current-20260609`.
- Fresh artifact: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-12b-jang4m-tools-nomedia-current-20260609/summary.json` is `status=fail`, `failed=1`; result JSON is `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-12b-jang4m-tools-nomedia-current-20260609/JANGQ_gemma-4-12B-it-JANG_4M/result.json`.
- Green in that proof: visible `ACK`, paged+mixed_swa second-hit cache telemetry (`cached_tokens=56`), multiturn recall, reasoning visible finalization, required `record_fact({"value":"blue-cat"})`, tool-result continuation `STORED blue-cat.`, JSON exactness, mixed-SWA prefix/paged/block-L2 active, and block-disk L2 writes.
- Remaining current blockers: exact code whitespace emits a leading space before `print(add(2, 3))`; native mixed-SWA storage quantization is disabled for safety, so the checklist keeps that row open; media artifact remains missing separately.
- Refreshed checklist: `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-responses-raw-sse-gemma-surface-20260609.json` remains `status=open`, `failed_count=112` instead of 119.
- Verification: focused checklist pointer tests passed `2/2`; `py_compile` passed for changed checklist/test files; `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: this is current partial source proof, not Gemma release clearance, installed-app/UI proof, package, signing, notarization, tag, or download.

# 2026-06-09 - Responses raw-SSE local guard split

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, no package/sign/notarize/tag/download release action.
- Reduced blocker class: Responses/API tool-call streaming proof classification for Qwen/N2/Gemma-family tool reliability.
- Source/proof fix: `tests/cross_matrix/run_responses_raw_sse_parity_contract.py` now consumes the current no-heavy Responses streaming contract and records local source guard booleans for empty XML fail-closed behavior, output-index ordering, gateway argument passthrough, and stale Responses port rejection.
- Refreshed artifact: `build/current-responses-raw-sse-parity-direct-gateway-tunnel-gemma4-e2b-after-parser-20260609.json` remains `status=fail`, but `local_responses_streaming_guards_pass=true`, `local_empty_xml_arguments_fail_closed=true`, `local_output_index_ordering_guard=true`, and `gateway_argument_stream_passthrough_guard=true`.
- Refreshed full checklist: `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-responses-raw-sse-gemma-surface-20260609.json` remains `status=open`, `failed_count=119`; the open Responses rows are now same-model tunnel availability/arguments and missing actual reasoning events, not local `arguments:{}` or duplicate output-index source guards.
- Verification: focused pytest passed `22/22`; `py_compile` passed for changed Python/test files; `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: this does not clear same-model direct/gateway/tunnel raw-SSE parity, Gemma/N2/MiMo live runtime media/cache/UI rows, installed-app parity, signing, notarization, tag, or download rows.

# 2026-06-09 - Runtime patch package parity coverage

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, no release package/sign/notarize/tag/download work.
- Reduced blocker class: packaged/runtime parity for auto-installed upstream runtime patch shims spanning Gemma4 image recovery, Kimi MLA decode stability, DSV4 model registration, and MLX/MLX-VLM compatibility fixes.
- Root cause found: `vmlx_engine/runtime_patches/__init__.py` auto-installs `deepseek_v4_register`, `gemma4_processing`, `gemma4_vision`, `kimi_k25_mla`, `mlx_lm_compat`, and `mlx_vlm_compat`, but package hash gates only covered `gemma4_processing`, `mlx_lm_compat`, and `mlx_vlm_compat`. A rebuilt package could silently omit or stale Gemma4 mixed pixel-value list coercion, Kimi fp32 MLA patch install, or DSV4 model-type registration while source tests stayed green.
- Source/proof fix: added `runtime_patches/deepseek_v4_register.py`, `runtime_patches/gemma4_vision.py`, and `runtime_patches/kimi_k25_mla.py` to bundled-python, release-gate, packaged-integrity, and installed-app parity hash surfaces. Added all auto-installed runtime patch modules plus `tests/test_kimi_k25_mla_patch.py` to current-suite source hashes.
- Regression: package/parity and current-suite tests now assert that every auto-installed runtime patch module is hash-covered.
- Red/green proof: the focused package/current-suite test set failed before the manifest fix on missing runtime patch files, then passed after the fix (`6 passed`).
- Boundary: package/parity/source-hash coverage only. This protects rebuild drift but does not clear live Gemma full media/UI/tunnel, Kimi live quality, DSV4 memory-gated tool-loop, N2/MiMo rows, signing, notarization, tag, or download rows.

# 2026-06-09 - Installed app rebuild and package parity checkpoint

- Rebuilt bundled Python and installed `/Applications/vMLX.app` from current source with `panel/scripts/build-and-install.sh`.
- Fixed a real bundle bootstrap issue in `panel/scripts/bundle-python.sh`: after extracting the Python standalone tarball, the script now restores launcher/runtime files before the first pip invocation and uses the concrete `python3.12` launcher during bootstrap. It also restores the launcher again after MLX wheel installation before dependency installation. This addresses the observed missing `python3` / `unknown encoding: cp437` rebuild failure without changing model/runtime behavior.
- Installed app proof: `build/current-installed-app-runtime-parity-audit-after-installed-app-rebuild-20260606.json` is `status=pass`. The installed bundled Python imports `vmlx_engine 1.5.56`, `mlx 0.31.2`, `mlx-lm 0.31.3`, `mlx-vlm 0.5.0`, TurboQuant disk/cache modules, SSM companion cache/disk store, Gemma4 Unified registration, native MTP, and Qwen35 MTP patches.
- Packaged integrity proof: `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-after-installed-app-rebuild-20260606.json` is still `status=fail`, but only for `packaged_app_developer_id_signing_blocked`. The release-gate unit contracts pass `47/47` and bundled verifier passes. Developer ID private-key access is blocked from this non-interactive keychain state (`developer_id_keychain_user_interaction_not_allowed`).
- Full checklist proof: `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-responses-raw-sse-gemma-surface-20260609.json` remains `status=open`, `failed_count=73`.
- Boundary: the local `/Applications/vMLX.app` is ad-hoc signed and codesign-valid, not a Developer ID signed/notarized checkpoint DMG. No tag, upload, appcast, notarization, or release action was performed.

# 2026-06-09 - Signed checkpoint DMG readiness audit

- Added `tests/cross_matrix/run_signed_checkpoint_dmg_audit.py` to capture the current signing/notary state without building, signing, notarizing, uploading, tagging, or mutating updater feeds.
- Fresh artifact `build/current-signed-checkpoint-dmg-readiness-20260609.json` is `status=open`.
- Existing local `panel/release/vMLX-1.5.56-sequoia-arm64.dmg` and `panel/release/vMLX-1.5.56-tahoe-arm64.dmg` are Developer ID signed, stapled, and Gatekeeper accepted, with hashes `a7148d42e27ee8eccb428a460bc4aa643b227a25ef394aed7dbebe3f3763fd5c` and `faa049368ce7c3f67dbf20b24e250bbc901493d81d382e924d30789d2b067c56`.
- Those DMGs are June 5 artifacts and are not current-source checkpoint proof for HEAD `8324bf11`.
- Current `/Applications/vMLX.app` is codesign-valid but ad-hoc signed. Fresh Developer ID signing is blocked with `errSecInternalComponent`; `xcrun notarytool history --keychain ~/Library/Keychains/vmlx-build.keychain-db --keychain-profile vmlx-notary` is blocked because `vmlx-build.keychain-db` is locked.
- Required next sequence: unlock `vmlx-build.keychain-db`, restore `codesign` partition-list access, rerun the fresh signing probe, rebuild current-source Sequoia/Tahoe DMGs, notarize with `VMLINUX_NOTARY_KEYCHAIN=$HOME/Library/Keychains/vmlx-build.keychain-db`, staple, verify, and only then consider upload/tag/appcast release steps.

# 2026-06-09 - Qwen/N2 native-MTP package parity coverage

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, no release package/sign/notarize/tag/download work.
- Upstream context checked: `ml-explore/mlx-swift-lm` PR #323 calls out Qwen3.6/`qwen3_5` hybrid linear-attention/GatedDelta cache behavior, contiguous convolution state, cache metadata advancement, and padded-generation stability.
- Reduced blocker class: N2/Qwen3.6 native-MTP activation and text-side MTP patch package parity, including the prior `gdn_sink`/GatedDelta patch surface.
- Root cause found: package hash gates covered `patches/mlx_vlm_mtp/qwen35_vl.py` but not `native_mtp.py` or `patches/mlx_lm_mtp/*`. Runtime activation imports `native_mtp.py`, `patches/mlx_lm_mtp/__init__.py`, `batch_generator.py`, `cache_rollback.py`, `deepseek_v4_model.py`, and `qwen35_model.py`; a stale packaged Python could silently drift on Qwen/N2 native-MTP detection, GatedDelta patching, rollback state, or BatchGenerator draft/verify dispatch while source tests stayed green.
- Source/proof fix: added those native-MTP files to `panel/scripts/verify-bundled-python.sh`, `panel/scripts/release-gate-python-app.py`, `tests/cross_matrix/run_packaged_integrity_contract.py`, and `tests/cross_matrix/run_installed_app_runtime_parity_audit.py`.
- Regression: package/parity tests now assert the native-MTP activation module and `mlx_lm_mtp` patch files are covered in the release gate, bundled verifier, staged app integrity gate, and installed-app runtime parity audit.
- Red/green proof: the focused package/parity test set failed before the manifest fix on missing `native_mtp.py` / `patches/mlx_lm_mtp/*`, then passed after the fix (`4 passed`).
- Boundary: package/parity coverage only. This does not run or clear live N2 JANG_1L/JANGTQ cache/API/UI, Qwen/N2 MTP quality, MiMo exactness/media, Gemma installed-app/UI/tunnel, signing, notarization, tag, or download rows.

# 2026-06-09 - TQ-native disk cache package parity coverage

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, no release package/sign/notarize/tag/download work.
- Reduced blocker class: N2/Qwen/MiMo-family TurboQuant L2 disk-cache encode/decode and cache-restore safety package parity.
- Root cause found: `vmlx_engine/tq_disk_store.py` is the TQ-native disk serialization path used by `disk_cache.py` for compressed `TurboQuantKVCache` records, and `vmlx_engine/cache_record_validator.py` guards TQ-native metadata plus live/prefix/block/SSM/JANGTQ cache restores before unsafe allocations. Both files were covered by focused runtime tests, but missing from bundled-python, release-gate, packaged-integrity, and installed-app parity hash lists. A stale package could therefore drift on TQ disk encode/decode or cache validation while source tests stayed green.
- Source/proof fix: added `cache_record_validator.py` and `tq_disk_store.py` to `panel/scripts/verify-bundled-python.sh`, `panel/scripts/release-gate-python-app.py`, `tests/cross_matrix/run_packaged_integrity_contract.py`, and `tests/cross_matrix/run_installed_app_runtime_parity_audit.py`.
- Regression: package/parity tests now assert both files are covered in the release gate, bundled verifier, staged app integrity gate, and installed-app runtime parity audit.
- Red/green proof: the focused package/parity test set failed before the manifest fix on missing `cache_record_validator.py` / `tq_disk_store.py`, then passed after the fix (`4 passed`).
- Boundary: package/parity coverage only. This does not run or clear live N2 cache/tool/UI, MiMo exactness/media/L2, Gemma installed-app/UI/tunnel, signing, notarization, tag, or download rows.

# 2026-06-09 - Qwen/N2 hybrid TurboQuant package parity coverage

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, no release package/sign/notarize/tag/download work.
- Reduced blocker class: N2/Qwen-family hybrid SSM + TurboQuant KV packaged/runtime parity.
- Root cause found: `vmlx_engine/utils/hybrid_tq_cache.py` controls Qwen3.6/N2 selective live TurboQuant KV for attention layers while preserving SSM companion caches, and is imported by scheduler/tokenizer/JANG loader paths, but it was missing from bundled-python, release-gate, packaged-integrity, and installed-app parity hash lists. A stale packaged helper could silently alter N2/Qwen hybrid cache behavior after source tests passed.
- Source/proof fix: added `utils/hybrid_tq_cache.py` to `panel/scripts/verify-bundled-python.sh`, `panel/scripts/release-gate-python-app.py`, `tests/cross_matrix/run_packaged_integrity_contract.py`, and `tests/cross_matrix/run_installed_app_runtime_parity_audit.py`.
- Regression: package/parity tests now assert that `utils/hybrid_tq_cache.py` is covered in the release gate, bundled verifier, staged app integrity gate, and installed-app runtime parity audit.
- Red/green proof: the focused package/parity test set failed before the manifest fix on missing `utils/hybrid_tq_cache.py`, then passed after the fix (`6 passed`, including current-suite source-hash guards). `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: package/parity coverage only. This does not run or clear N2 JANG_1L/JANGTQ live cache/tool/UI proof, DSV4, MiMo exactness/media, Gemma installed-app/UI/tunnel, signing, notarization, tag, or download rows.

# 2026-06-09 - Gemma4 Unified packaged parity hash coverage

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, no release package/sign/notarize/tag/download work.
- Reduced blocker class: Gemma4 packaged/bundled runtime parity for `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mlx_vlm.models.gemma4_unified'`.
- Root cause found: source already resolves `mlx_vlm.models.gemma4_unified` after `import vmlx_engine`, and `panel/scripts/verify-bundled-python.sh` already hash-gates and import-gates the Gemma4 Unified vendored runtime. The stale gap was that installed-app parity and packaged-integrity hash lists did not include `models/gemma4_unified_register.py` or `models/gemma4_unified/*`, so a rebuilt package could miss or stale those files without the parity audits naming the exact drift.
- Source fix: added Gemma4 Unified register/config/runtime/processor files to `panel/scripts/release-gate-python-app.py`, `tests/cross_matrix/run_installed_app_runtime_parity_audit.py`, and `tests/cross_matrix/run_packaged_integrity_contract.py`.
- Regression: added assertions in `tests/test_installed_app_runtime_parity_audit.py`, `tests/test_packaged_integrity_contract.py`, and `tests/test_release_gate_python_app.py` so the package/parity gates must keep these Gemma4 Unified files covered.
- Red/green proof: the focused test set failed before the manifest fix on missing `models/gemma4_unified_register.py`, then passed after the fix (`4 passed`).
- Boundary: source/package-gate coverage only. It prevents silent omission after rebuild, but does not rebuild the app, does not prove installed-app parity green, and does not clear Gemma media/cache/UI/tunnel release rows.

# 2026-06-09 - Single-active cache max_kv_size hybrid guard

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, no release package/sign/notarize/tag/download work.
- Reduced blocker class: cache policy safety for Gemma4, MiMo V2, N2/Qwen3.6, and future mixed sliding/full or hybrid cache families.
- Upstream intake checked: `ml-explore/mlx-lm` PR #1343 (`Apply max_kv_size to KVCache layers returned by make_cache()`, opened 2026-06-03). The PR makes explicit `max_kv_size` affect plain `KVCache` entries returned by `model.make_cache()`, but its own notes call out early-context recall loss on interleaved attention because global/full layers become bounded rotating windows.
- Source fix: `vmlx_engine/utils/single_batch_generator.py` now preserves architecture-owned mixed/hybrid `make_cache()` semantics when `max_kv_size` is present. Known Gemma4/Gemma4 Unified, MiMo V2, Qwen3.6/N2 model types, explicit `cache_type=hybrid`, hybrid/mixed/SWA/SSM/Mamba subtypes, or mixed `sliding` plus `full/global` layer types suppress the generic cap and log a warning. Ordinary KV models still pass `max_kv_size` through.
- Regression: `tests/test_single_active_batch_generator.py` now proves plain KV keeps `max_kv_size=128`, while `gemma4`, `mimo_v2`, `qwen3_5_moe`, and future mixed sliding/full layer-type configs pass `max_kv_size=None` into `mlx_cache.make_prompt_cache`.
- Proof-map fix: current regression-suite source hashes and focused pytest command now include `vmlx_engine/utils/single_batch_generator.py` and `tests/test_single_active_batch_generator.py`.
- Validation passed:
  - `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_single_active_batch_generator.py tests/test_current_regression_suite.py::test_current_regression_suite_hashes_focused_pytest_gate_sources tests/test_current_regression_suite.py::test_current_regression_suite_runs_single_active_cache_policy_guard tests/test_current_regression_suite.py::test_current_regression_suite_source_hash_list_matches_release_manifest` -> `20 passed`.
  - `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed for changed files.
- Boundary: this is a no-heavy guard against unsafe generic cache bounding. It does not clear live N2 JANG_1L, MiMo exactness/media, Gemma installed-app/UI/tunnel, DSV4, package, signing, notarization, tag, or download rows.

# 2026-06-09 - Release blocker ledger refresh

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; did not touch deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, ADLab, Max2 transport lanes, or old Swift paths.
- Added `.agents/RELEASE_BLOCKER_LEDGER_2026_06_09.md` as the current coordination handoff for a second agent.
- Wrote the active blocker ledger into `.agents/STATUS.md` so continuations do not lose the release boundary.
- Explicitly recorded that N2/JANG_1L should fit with careful RAM handling; current blocker is live-proof scheduling and headroom discipline, not permanent infeasibility.
- Explicitly recorded the Responses tool-argument streaming sub-issue: trace empty `tc_args` at the `if tc_args:` streaming branch, `_parse_tool_calls_with_parser`, and delta accumulation when reasoning is enabled. No disabling reasoning as a fix.
- Explicitly recorded gateway/tunnel/port/wake/sleep/session-routing checks so engine parser bugs are not conflated with deployed tunnel/model availability.
- Explicitly recorded `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mlx_vlm.models.gemma4_unified'` as an installed/bundled runtime parity blocker for Gemma4.
- Hard release boundary remains: no fake guards, no forced generation defaults, no package/sign/notarize/tag/download until runtime/model/UI/cache/installed-app rows are actually green or Eric explicitly overrides.

# 2026-06-09 - Gemma4 shared-KV mlx-format load fix

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, no release package/sign/notarize/tag/download work.
- Reduced blocker class: Gemma4 QAT/native MXFP4 and mlx-community Gemma4 mlx-format load compatibility.
- Upstream intake checked: `Blaizzy/mlx-vlm` PR #1336 (`Fix gemma4 load for mlx-format checkpoints that materialize KV-shared k/v`, opened 2026-06-09). The upstream root cause is that `load_model` can skip `sanitize` for mlx-format checkpoints, so materialized shared-layer k/v tensors reach strict `load_weights` even after shared-KV modules are correctly omitted.
- Source fix: `vmlx_engine/runtime_patches/mlx_vlm_compat.py` now uses a shared Gemma4 unused shared-KV filter for `Model.sanitize`, `LanguageModel.sanitize`, and `Model.load_weights`. The load-weight wrapper filters known-unused materialized `k_proj`/`v_proj`/`k_norm`/`v_norm` tensors on shared-KV layers before strict load, while unrelated missing/extra weights still fail.
- Regression: `tests/test_mlx_lm_runtime_patches.py::test_mlx_vlm_gemma4_shared_kv_load_weights_drops_mlx_format_materialized_kv` builds a tiny Gemma4 shared-KV model and proves strict `load_weights` accepts a full parameter list plus one materialized shared-layer k/v tensor.
- Validation passed:
  - `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_mlx_lm_runtime_patches.py` -> `11 passed`.
  - `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_current_regression_suite.py::test_current_regression_suite_hashes_mlx_lm_runtime_patch_sources tests/test_current_regression_suite.py::test_current_regression_suite_hashes_focused_pytest_gate_sources tests/test_current_regression_suite.py::test_current_regression_suite_source_hash_list_matches_release_manifest` -> `3 passed`.
  - `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed for the changed runtime patch/test files.
- Boundary: source/no-heavy Gemma4 load compatibility only. This does not clear Gemma live media, installed-app/UI/tunnel, N2, MiMo exactness, DSV4, package, signing, notarization, tag, or download rows.

# 2026-06-09 - Step3.7 VLM audit proof refresh

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, no release package/sign/notarize/tag/download work.
- Reduced blocker class: `media` + `runtime/kernel` proof classification for Step3.7 VLM routing.
- Regenerated `build/current-step37-vlm-runtime-audit-after-source-live-media-proof-20260607.json`; `status=pass`, `release_clearance=audit_does_not_block_release`, `mlx_vlm_step3p7_runtime_available=true`.
- The audit is no-heavy and honest: `source_owned_runtime_progress.release_clearance=source_runtime_surface_present_needs_live_proof`; `live_media_proof.exists=false` and `live_media_proof.pass=false`, so live image/video media proof remains required before release clearance.
- Refreshed full checklist `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-responses-raw-sse-gemma-surface-20260609.json`; `status=open`, `failed_count=121`. The stale Step3.7 missing-audit rows are gone; release remains blocked by Responses tunnel/reasoning, N2, MiMo, Gemma full matrix, Qwen proof gaps, DSV4, and packaging/UI rows.
- Boundary: this is not a fake `has_vision=false` claim and not Step3.7 media release clearance. It only restores the current source-runtime audit artifact and keeps live media proof separate.

# 2026-06-09 - MiniMax #179 local generation config fallback

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, no release package/sign/notarize/tag/download work.
- Reduced blocker class: `parser/template` + `generation config` proof classification for MiniMax #179 wrong-language/planning isolation.
- Source/proof gate fix: `tests/cross_matrix/run_issue179_minimax_k_root_cause_audit.py` now falls back to direct local MiniMax artifact metadata when the old manifest JSON is absent. It hashes only small metadata/config files and intentionally does not hash 67 large safetensor shards.
- Refreshed artifact: `build/current-issue179-minimax-k-root-cause-audit-after-parser-settings-parity-20260608.json`, `status=open`. Local fallback found `/Users/eric/models/dealign.ai/MiniMax-M2.7-JANGTQ_K-CRACK`, `generation_config.json`, `jang_config.json`, tokenizer/config/index metadata, and 67 model shards. `generation_config.json` hash is `2c24fe5507e260bb081727e2a14693d9a982942e721b28720c184d201bffb9dd`.
- The `generation_config_and_sampling` isolation row moved from `open` to `partial` because local generation config is present and local/reporter sampling shape is seen.
- Boundary: this does not clear #179. Reporter-machine generation config hash parity, resolved sampling kwargs parity, reporter raw SSE/session/cancel lifecycle, and full model shard/codebook hash parity remain open.

# 2026-06-09 - Responses raw-SSE reasoning-disable boundary split

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, no release package/sign/notarize/tag/download work.
- Reduced blocker class: `api/ui` proof classification for Responses streaming tool arguments across direct local server, panel gateway, and tunnel.
- Source/proof gate fix: `tests/cross_matrix/run_responses_raw_sse_parity_contract.py` now accepts per-surface server logs and separates `no_reasoning_disable_workaround` from `all_present_surfaces_have_required_reasoning`.
- Current direct/gateway Gemma4 E2B captures now prove the request path did not disable reasoning: both server logs contain `Reasoning: ENABLED` and resolved `/v1/responses` sampling kwargs with `enable_thinking=True`.
- Refreshed artifact: `build/current-responses-raw-sse-parity-direct-gateway-tunnel-gemma4-e2b-after-parser-20260609.json`, `status=fail`. Direct and gateway preserve authoritative `record_fact` args `{"value": "blue-cat"}`, parse cleanly, use valid output indices, match model `gemma4-e2b-sse`, and have `no_reasoning_disable_workaround=true`; the tunnel capture is present but returns `model_not_found` for `gemma4-e2b-sse`, and direct/gateway still have `reasoning_events=0`.
- Full objective checklist regenerated at `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-responses-raw-sse-gemma-surface-20260609.json`; `status=open`, `failed_count=124` after the tunnel capture was included and classified as same-model `model_not_found`.
- Live tunnel model-list check: `https://testapi.adlabus.dev/v1/models` currently advertises 11 models, including `Gemma-4-12B-it-MXFP8-CRACK` / `models/Gemma-4-12B-it-MXFP8-CRACK` and Qwen35 MXFP8 MTP aliases, but not `gemma4-e2b-sse`. Treat the same-model Gemma4 E2B tunnel failure as deployed tunnel/session routing availability until that model is served by the tunnel or the parity target is changed with matching direct/gateway/tunnel captures.
- Boundary: this is not Responses parity clearance. Remaining proof is same-model tunnel raw SSE plus actual reasoning events, without changing the request to hide reasoning.

# 2026-06-09 - MiniMax #179 language/planning isolation matrix

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, no release package/sign/notarize/tag/download work.
- Reduced blocker class: `parser/template` + `cache/storage` classification for MiniMax #179 wrong-language / visible-planning / numeric reasoning screenshot.
- Source/proof gate fix: `tests/cross_matrix/run_issue179_minimax_k_root_cause_audit.py` now emits `language_planning_leak_isolation` with six single-axis rows:
  1. `reporter_exact_prompt_reproduction`
  2. `generation_config_and_sampling`
  3. `parser_template_reasoning`
  4. `paged_prefix_cache`
  5. `block_disk_l2`
  6. `turboquant_kv`
- Refreshed artifact: `build/current-issue179-minimax-k-root-cause-audit-after-parser-settings-parity-20260608.json`, `status=open`. Current classification: parser/template, paged prefix cache, block-disk L2, and TurboQuant KV are only `partial`; reporter exact prompt reproduction and generation-config/hash parity remain `open`.
- Required next evidence is explicit now: reporter-machine raw SSE/session/cancel lifecycle capture; generation config hash + resolved sampling parity; rendered chat template hash and thinking-template flag parity; cache on/off same-prompt A/B; fresh-process L2 restore same-prompt A/B; TQ KV on/off same-prompt A/B.
- Validation:
  - New regression failed before the field existed, then `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_issue179_minimax_k_root_cause_audit.py::test_issue179_audit_tracks_language_planning_leak_isolation_axes` passed.
  - Full `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_issue179_minimax_k_root_cause_audit.py` passed (`19 passed`).
- Boundary: this is not #179 clearance. Do not “fix” MiniMax by disabling cache, L2, TQ KV, reasoning, or changing sampling unless the matching same-prompt single-axis A/B proof identifies that axis.

# 2026-06-09 - Gemma QAT media-backed inventory gate

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, release packaging, signing, notarization, tag, or download work.
- Reduced blocker class: `media` + `parser/template` proof classification for Gemma QAT/native MXFP4 release rows.
- Source gate fix: `tests/cross_matrix/run_gemma_qat_native_mxfp4_inventory_gate.py` now separates config-advertised modalities from weight-backed/runtime-proven modalities.
- New no-heavy evidence in `build/current-gemma-qat-native-mxfp4-local-inventory-after-source-smoke-map-20260609.json`:
  - Gemma4 E2B/E4B QAT/native MXFP4 have `audio_tower.*` and vision weights; source smokes remain narrower than installed-app/UI/tunnel proof.
  - Gemma4 12B QAT/native MXFP4 has image weights (`vision_embedder`/`embed_vision`) but only `embed_audio.embedding_projection.weight`, so audio metadata is not native audio proof.
  - Gemma4 12B/26B/31B have video token metadata but no video-specific weight family; checklist now records that live frame-through-vision runtime proof is still required.
- Full objective checklist regenerated at `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-responses-raw-sse-gemma-surface-20260609.json`; `status=open`, `failed_count=122` after the follow-up honest 12B audio gate and current artifact refresh, with explicit Gemma rows for 12B audio gating/backing and 12B/26B/31B video runtime proof.
- Validation passed:
  - `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_gemma_qat_native_mxfp4_inventory_gate.py tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py::test_full_release_objective_checklist_blocks_open_gemma_qat_inventory tests/test_current_regression_suite.py::test_current_regression_suite_hashes_gemma_qat_inventory_gate_sources tests/test_current_regression_suite.py::test_current_regression_suite_runs_gemma_qat_inventory_gate tests/test_objective_proof_digest.py::test_objective_proof_digest_tracks_gemma_qat_native_mxfp4_release_blocker` -> `10 passed`.
  - `py_compile` passed for changed Gemma inventory/checklist source and tests.
  - `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: this is an honest proof-classification/source-gate fix. It does not clear Gemma release rows; remaining work is live Responses/tool/media/cache/UI/installed-app parity and tunnel/gateway proof.

# 2026-06-09 - N2 JANG_1L careful-RAM preflight and blocker ledger refresh

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, no Max2/adlab/transport lane.
- Reduced blocker class: `runtime/kernel` + `cache/storage` proof scheduling for N2 Pro JANG_1L.
- User boundary recorded: JANG_1L should fit just fine as long as RAM is handled carefully; treat this as a careful live-proof scheduling problem, not permanent infeasibility. Do not run source-vs-quant or extra-heavy comparisons unless Eric explicitly allows.
- Observed runtime fact from current status: conservative N2 JANG_1L launch on port `8899` reached server startup and then aborted with Metal OOM after `Wired limit set to 115 GB (model 119 GB)`.
- Source/proof-harness fixes landed in current tip `8caefd24` (`Tighten N2 JANG1L memory proof gate`):
  - `tests/cross_matrix/run_n2_jang1l_memory_preflight.py` now uses `DEFAULT_REQUIRED_EXTRA_HEADROOM_GIB = 8.0` and labels the threshold as Metal/runtime headroom.
  - `tests/cross_matrix/run_n2_chat_cache_gate.py` now returns a structured `status=fail` artifact on early server exit/startup abort instead of losing OOM evidence.
- Refreshed artifact: `build/current-n2-pro-jang1l-local-memory-preflight-20260609.json`, `status=open`, `decision=do_not_launch`, `indexed_payload_gib=110.57`, `available_gib=114.64`, `required_available_gib=118.57`, `required_extra_headroom_gib=8.0`, `memory_gap_gib=3.93`.
- Validation passed:
  - `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_n2_jang1l_memory_preflight.py tests/test_n2_chat_cache_gate.py tests/test_objective_proof_digest.py::test_objective_proof_digest_tracks_n2_pro_397b_release_blocker tests/test_current_regression_suite.py::test_current_regression_suite_hashes_focused_pytest_gate_sources` -> `18 passed`.
  - `py_compile` passed for changed N2 runner/test/objective files.
  - `git diff --check` passed for changed N2 runner/test/objective files.
- Current release blocker ledger kept active:
  1. Responses streaming tool args: still need same-model raw SSE local vs gateway vs tunnel comparison with reasoning events; do not fix by disabling reasoning. Current source/no-heavy path preserves argument deltas/done and rejects empty required XML args, but tunnel same-model proof remains open.
  2. MiniMax random Chinese / visible planning: not cleared; no sampling clamp or fake sentinel. Isolate cache-on/off, TQ KV vs none, L2 vs no L2, parser/template boundary, and model-owned generation config.
  3. MiMo V2.5: JANGTQ2 speed/cache partial; JANG_2L plus exact tool/JSON/loop/VL/audio/video/UI proof remain open; no source-vs-quant if RAM-blocked unless Eric explicitly allows.
  4. N2 / Qwen-family JANG/JANGTQ: needs memory-safe live tool/reasoning/parser/cache proof, especially `gdn_sink`, MTP, hybrid cache, args streaming, and parser-leak rows.
  5. DSV4: memory-unit harness fixes landed; still needs live default-cache tool-loop proof above memory gate using native SWA/CSA/HCA cache, not generic fake KV.
  6. Gemma 4 / QAT native MXFP4: source startup/smokes exist, but full MXFP4/MXFP8/JANG_4M/QAT media/cache/UI/tunnel/installed-app matrix remains open, including VLM/image prefill recovery and post-error text recovery.
  7. Step 3.7: metadata/runtime route matrix improved; do not fake `has_vision=false` as release-wide VLM clearance. Tool dialect loops/raw XML leaks remain to prove per path.
  8. Structured JSON/XML: repair/validation is app/benchmark hygiene, not a substitute for runtime coherence. Guided/schema decoding only counts if real runtime support exists.
  9. UI/CLI parity: parser, reasoning, cache, max output/context, generation defaults must match CLI, API, panel settings, and installed app launch.
  10. Release: package gate/signing/notarization/tag/download remain blocked until runtime/model/UI/cache blockers are actually green or Eric explicitly overrides.

# 2026-06-09 - N2 JANGTQ2 Responses streaming SSE proof

- Scope: Python source server/live N2 JANGTQ2 proof in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx`; no release packaging, signing, notarization, tag, download, deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, Max2, ADLab, or Swift work.
- Source/proof harness: `tests/cross_matrix/run_n2_chat_cache_gate.py` now supports `--include-responses-stream-probe`, raw SSE parsing, argument delta/done/final item extraction, heartbeat counts, completed status, and Responses cache telemetry for streaming tool calls.
- Red/green: new unit contracts for streaming Responses payload/SSE extraction failed before implementation, then passed.
- Validation:
  - `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_n2_chat_cache_gate.py` -> `8 passed`.
  - `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile tests/cross_matrix/run_n2_chat_cache_gate.py tests/test_n2_chat_cache_gate.py` -> pass.
  - `git diff --check -- tests/cross_matrix/run_n2_chat_cache_gate.py tests/test_n2_chat_cache_gate.py` -> pass.
- Live command: `.venv/bin/python tests/cross_matrix/run_n2_chat_cache_gate.py --model /Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/Nex-N2-Pro-JANGTQ2 --served-model-name n2-pro-jangtq2-responses-stream-proof --port 8876 --include-tool-probe --include-responses-probe --include-responses-stream-probe --max-tokens 16 --tool-max-tokens 64 --responses-max-output-tokens 64 --server-max-tokens 96 --out build/current-n2-jangtq2-responses-stream-tool-cache-proof-20260609.json --cache-dir build/current-n2-jangtq2-responses-stream-tool-cache-proof-block-cache-20260609`.
- Live artifact: `build/current-n2-jangtq2-responses-stream-tool-cache-proof-20260609.json`, `status=pass`.
- Live result: `stable_text=true`, `tool_probe_pass=true`, `responses_probe_pass=true`, `responses_stream_probe_pass=true`, `cache_hit_cached_tokens=8`, `cache_hit_cache_detail=paged+ssm`, `server_exit=-15`.
- Streaming Responses row: HTTP 200, `completed_status=completed`, `heartbeat_count=24`, function call `lookup`, parsed args `{"query":"alpha"}`, `cached_tokens=192`, `cache_detail=paged+ssm`; raw SSE preserved arguments in `response.function_call_arguments.delta`, `response.function_call_arguments.done`, and final `response.output_item.done`.
- Boundary: this proves local source N2 JANGTQ2 streaming Responses tool args through the server. It does not prove tunnel/gateway parity, installed app/UI execution, JANG_1L, media/VL/audio/video, L2 restart restore, native MTP/`gdn_sink` edge cases, or release readiness.

# 2026-06-09 - Release blocker ledger refresh for second-agent handoff

- Coordination-only update in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, ADLab, Max2, Swift, source-vs-quant, package, signing, notarization, tag, or download work in this slice.
- Refreshed `.agents/STATUS.md` and `.agents/RELEASE_BLOCKER_LEDGER_20260609.md` so a second agent can pick up the same active release blockers without relying on chat context.
- Active rows kept open: Responses streaming tool args; MiniMax random Chinese/visible planning under cache; MiMo V2.5 JANGTQ2/JANG_2L exactness/tools/cache/media/UI; N2/Qwen JANG/JANGTQ tools/reasoning/MTP/gdn_sink/hybrid cache/UI; DSV4 native SWA/CSA/HCA tool-loop and exact output; Gemma4 MXFP4/MXFP8/JANG_4M media/cache/UI; Step3.7 VLM/tool dialect/loop behavior; structured JSON/XML repair vs real guided decoding; UI/CLI parity; release signing/notarization/download gate.
- Added explicit Responses source trace item: the reported finalizer branch near line `13592` checks `if tc_args:`; if args are empty with reasoning on, trace accumulated reasoning/content text, `_parse_tool_calls_with_parser`, filtering/schema coercion, streaming delta accumulation, and `response.output_item.done` before blaming tunnel, model, or UI.
- Added explicit gateway/port/wake-sleep release row: compare direct local SSE, MLXStudio gateway SSE, and tunnel SSE; prove stale/dead backend ports fail cleanly; prove sleep/wake/restart/cancel do not reuse stale parser buffers, tool-call accumulators, `previous_response_id`, cache/L2 state, or half-open streams.
- Hard boundary preserved: no fake fixes by disabling reasoning, clamping sampling, hiding raw output, forcing metadata, prompt-only rewrites, JSON/XML repair, or release-manifest wording. Use model-owned generation config and prove real runtime/cache/parser/UI behavior.
- Release boundary: no signing/notarization/tag/download until runtime/model/UI/cache gates are green or Eric explicitly overrides the lock. Release notes must credit GitHub `@Hornsan1`.

# 2026-06-09 - N2 JANGTQ2 Responses tool continuation

- Pushed `17377a97` (`Prove N2 Responses tool continuation`) to `origin/main` and `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- Included other-agent `f42ca32e` and `6c815188` before push.
- Source/proof harness: `tests/cross_matrix/run_n2_chat_cache_gate.py` now supports `--include-responses-probe`, flat Responses tool payloads, Responses function-call extraction, `function_call_output` follow-up with `previous_response_id`, final text extraction, and Responses cache telemetry extraction.
- Live artifact: `build/current-n2-jangtq2-responses-tool-cache-proof-20260609.json`.
- Live result: `status=pass`, `stable_text=true`, `tool_probe_pass=true`, `responses_probe_pass=true`, `cache_hit_cached_tokens=8`, `cache_hit_cache_detail=paged+ssm`.
- Live Responses rows:
  - required-tool round returned HTTP 200 `lookup({"query":"alpha"})` and cache telemetry `cached_tokens=192`, `cache_detail=paged+ssm`.
  - follow-up round sent `function_call_output` with `previous_response_id`, returned visible `DONE`, and emitted no second tool call.
- Verification:
  - red unit contracts failed before implementation.
  - `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_n2_chat_cache_gate.py` -> `6 passed`.
  - `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile tests/cross_matrix/run_n2_chat_cache_gate.py tests/test_n2_chat_cache_gate.py` -> pass.
  - `git diff --check -- tests/cross_matrix/run_n2_chat_cache_gate.py tests/test_n2_chat_cache_gate.py` -> pass.
- Boundary: N2 is still not release-cleared. This proves non-streaming Responses tool continuation/cache only for JANGTQ2; streaming Responses SSE, reasoning/parser leak checks, MTP/gdn_sink/hybrid edge rows, JANG_1L memory-gated path, UI parity, and installed-app proof remain open.

# 2026-06-09 - N2 JANGTQ2 chat/cache/tool proof

- Pushed `0c265976` (`Prove N2 chat tools in cache gate`) to `origin/main` and `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- Included other-agent `30fa08ee` before push.
- Source/proof harness: `tests/cross_matrix/run_n2_chat_cache_gate.py` now supports `--include-tool-probe`, extracts OpenAI tool calls/arguments, separates cache-row text stability from tool rows, and uses `--tool-max-tokens` so tool parsing is not falsely failed by truncation.
- Live artifact: `build/current-n2-jangtq2-chat-tool-cache-proof-20260609.json`.
- Live result: `status=pass`, `stable_text=true`, `tool_probe_pass=true`, `cache_hit_cached_tokens=8`, `cache_hit_cache_detail=paged+ssm`.
- Live rows:
  - no-cache/warm/cache-hit all returned HTTP 200 visible `ACK`.
  - warm row used `paged+ssm+disk`; cache-hit row used `paged+ssm`.
  - required tool row returned HTTP 200 OpenAI tool call `lookup` with parsed args `{"query":"alpha"}` and `cached_tokens=192`, `cache_detail=paged+ssm+disk`.
- Verification:
  - red unit contract failed before implementation.
  - `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_n2_chat_cache_gate.py` -> `3 passed`.
  - `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile tests/cross_matrix/run_n2_chat_cache_gate.py tests/test_n2_chat_cache_gate.py` -> pass.
  - `git diff --check -- tests/cross_matrix/run_n2_chat_cache_gate.py tests/test_n2_chat_cache_gate.py` -> pass.
- Boundary: N2 is still not release-cleared. This proves JANGTQ2 chat/cache/required-tool only; Responses streaming/tool-result continuation, reasoning/parser leaks, MTP/gdn_sink/hybrid edge rows, JANG_1L memory-gated path, UI parity, and installed-app proof remain open.

# 2026-06-09 - N2 VLM logprob proof boundary

- Pushed `2534bbe0` (`Classify N2 VLM logprob proof boundary`) to `origin/main` and `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- Included other-agent `08d69a25` before push.
- Root cause: the N2 JANGTQ2 cache-vs-nocache next-token proof was hitting unsupported logprob surfaces, not proving cache distribution drift. `/v1/completions` rejects MLLM/VLM N2, and `/v1/chat/completions` with logprobs is rejected by the server's truthful-data guard: multimodal/VLM logprobs are not implemented.
- Fix: `tests/cross_matrix/run_mimo_v2_cache_vs_nocache_next_token.py` now supports `--endpoint chat`, parses chat logprob shape when available, preserves 400 response detail in rows, and records `unsupported_boundary={status: skipped, reason: mllm_logprobs_unsupported}` for the exact VLM-logprobs guard.
- Live artifact refreshed: `build/current-n2-jangtq2-cache-vs-nocache-next-token-logprobs-20260609.json` now reports `status=skipped`, `endpoint=chat`, `reason=mllm_logprobs_unsupported`.
- Verification:
  - red no-heavy unit failed before implementation.
  - `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_mimo_v2_cache_vs_nocache_next_token.py` -> `3 passed`.
  - `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile tests/cross_matrix/run_mimo_v2_cache_vs_nocache_next_token.py tests/test_mimo_v2_cache_vs_nocache_next_token.py` -> pass.
  - `git diff --check -- tests/cross_matrix/run_mimo_v2_cache_vs_nocache_next_token.py tests/test_mimo_v2_cache_vs_nocache_next_token.py` -> pass.
- Boundary: N2 is not release-cleared. Valid current positive cache evidence remains `build/current-n2-jangtq2-chat-cache-proof-20260609.json`; N2 still needs tools/reasoning/parser/cache/UI/MTP/gdn_sink/hybrid proof and either real MLLM logprob support or an explicit release requirement change.

# 2026-06-09 - Responses argument SSE recovery

- Pushed `773380af` (`Recover Responses tool args from SSE events`) to `origin/main` and `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- Included other-agent `5c72b0e8` before push.
- Root cause boundary: panel execution previously trusted only final `response.output_item.done.item.arguments`; if a gateway/tunnel/runtime path carried arguments through `response.function_call_arguments.delta` / `.done` while final item args were empty, the panel could execute `{}`.
- Fix: `panel/src/main/ipc/chat.ts` now accumulates Responses argument delta/done events by item/output key and uses the recovered buffer as fallback for final function-call execution/status.
- Verification:
  - red focused contract failed before fix on missing argument-event accumulator.
  - `npm test -- --run tests/tool-status-responsiveness.test.ts` -> `8 passed`.
  - `npm test -- --run tests/api-gateway-single-model.behavior.test.ts --testNamePattern "passes Responses function-call argument SSE through unchanged|stale Responses session ports"` -> `2 passed, 22 skipped`.
  - `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false --skipLibCheck` -> pass.
  - `git diff --check -- panel/src/main/ipc/chat.ts panel/tests/tool-status-responsiveness.test.ts` -> pass.
- Boundary: no fake behavior. This preserves already-streamed arguments; it does not disable reasoning, clamp sampling, invent missing model args, or clear the reported-model/tunnel/live proof row.

# 2026-06-09 - Responses gateway heartbeat/wake cleanup contract

- Scope: Python engine plus MLXStudio panel in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, ADLab, transport, signing, notarization, or release packaging.
- Blocker: Responses streaming tool arguments may be lost through heartbeat-only streams, stale gateway ports, wake/sleep recovery, Cloudflare/tunnel framing, or stale panel tool-call buffers.
- Ledger update: release proof must compare direct local server SSE, panel gateway SSE, and tunnel SSE; `response.heartbeat` / `tool_call_generating=true` alone is not success. Argument bytes must survive through `response.function_call_arguments.delta`, `response.function_call_arguments.done`, `response.output_item.done`, and panel tool execution.
- Pushed `8ff395b7` (`Cover Responses tool buffer cleanup`) to `origin/main` and `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest` on top of the other agent's DSV4 restart/L2 commits `4e62954e` and `b114cf54`.
- Source contract: `panel/tests/tool-auto-continue.test.ts` now pins that `receivedToolCalls` and `clientToolCallBuffering` are cleared before follow-up, and stalled tool-call buffering cancels without executing stale calls.
- Verification:
  - `npm test -- --run tests/tool-auto-continue.test.ts --testNamePattern "clears Responses tool-call buffers"` -> `1 passed, 9 skipped`
  - `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false --skipLibCheck` -> pass
  - `git diff --check -- panel/tests/tool-auto-continue.test.ts` -> pass
- Boundary: no fake fix. No reasoning disable, sampling clamp, prompt-only rewrite, JSON repair, or release claim.

# 2026-06-09 - Responses stale gateway port coverage

- Pushed `c5b30f57` (`Cover stale Responses gateway ports`) to `origin/main` and `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- Added a gateway test for `/v1/responses` against a session marked `running` whose saved port has no backend listener.
- Expected behavior is explicit HTTP 502 `Backend unavailable`; no silent empty SSE, no tool-argument `{}` execution, no wake/start for a supposedly running session.
- Verification:
  - `npm test -- --run tests/api-gateway-single-model.behavior.test.ts --testNamePattern "stale Responses session ports|passes Responses function-call argument SSE through unchanged"` -> `2 passed, 22 skipped`
  - `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false --skipLibCheck` -> pass
  - `git diff --check` -> pass
- Boundary: simulated stale-port proof only. Live wake/sleep/restart/cache contamination and reported-model SSE proof remain open.

# 2026-06-09 - Responses gateway/panel function-call argument coverage

- Pushed `690440a2` (`Cover Responses gateway tool argument streaming`) to `origin/main` and `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- Added live gateway passthrough coverage in `panel/tests/api-gateway-single-model.behavior.test.ts` for `/v1/responses` SSE function-call argument events.
- Added app-side source contract in `panel/tests/tool-status-responsiveness.test.ts` so Responses tool execution uses final `response.output_item.done` arguments.
- Verification after rebase onto `a5026198`:
  - `npm test -- --run tests/api-gateway-single-model.behavior.test.ts --testNamePattern "passes Responses function-call argument SSE through unchanged"` -> `1 passed, 22 skipped`
  - `npm test -- --run tests/tool-status-responsiveness.test.ts` -> `7 passed`
  - `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false --skipLibCheck` -> pass
  - `git diff --check` -> pass
- Boundary: this closes synthetic gateway/panel regression coverage only. Actual reported model/tunnel/session/wake-cache issue still requires raw SSE capture and classification.

# 2026-06-09 - Responses gateway/port/wake-sleep blockers added

- Expanded `.agents/RELEASE_BLOCKER_LEDGER_20260609.md` so Responses issues are not treated as server-SSE only.
- Added required proof boundaries for API gateway SSE parity, stale/wrong port routing after server restart, wake/sleep or simulated disconnect recovery, cache/L2 restart preserving tool args, cancellation cleanup, and `previous_response_id` contamination checks.
- Boundary: coordination/list update only; no source test implementation in this slice yet.

# 2026-06-09 - Responses streaming regression pushed

- Rebasing included the other agent's latest main fixes before publishing this slice.
- Pushed `39d293fc` (`Cover Responses streaming tool arguments`) to `origin/main` and `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- Verification after rebase:
  - `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_server.py::TestOpenAILogprobsFormatting::test_streaming_responses_tool_call_arguments_survive_buffering tests/test_server.py::TestOpenAILogprobsFormatting::test_streaming_responses_reasoning_tool_call_keeps_arguments` -> `2 passed`
  - `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile tests/test_server.py vmlx_engine/server.py` -> pass
  - `git diff --check -- tests/test_server.py vmlx_engine/server.py` -> pass
- Boundary: no release claim. Next required proof is live reported-model raw SSE local-vs-tunnel-vs-panel classification.

# 2026-06-09 - Responses streaming function-call argument regression

- Added two focused raw-SSE regressions in `tests/test_server.py`:
  - `test_streaming_responses_tool_call_arguments_survive_buffering`
  - `test_streaming_responses_reasoning_tool_call_keeps_arguments`
- These cover native tool markup buffered behind `response.heartbeat` and finalization into `response.function_call_arguments.delta`, `response.function_call_arguments.done`, and `response.output_item.done` with the same non-empty JSON arguments.
- This directly tracks the reported sub-issue where `tc_args` can be empty at the Responses streaming finalizer when reasoning is on.
- Verification:
  - focused pytest nodes -> `2 passed`
  - `py_compile` for touched server/test/runtime files -> pass
  - `git diff --check` -> pass
- Boundary: synthetic local-engine proof only. Still need reported model/request raw SSE local vs tunnel vs panel proof before classifying the live user issue as engine, tunnel, or UI.

# 2026-06-09 - Active release blocker ledger for cross-agent work

- Wrote `.agents/RELEASE_BLOCKER_LEDGER_20260609.md` as the current full blocker/proof ledger.
- Purpose: make second-agent coordination explicit without relying on stale chat context.
- Preserved hard release boundary: no fake fixes, no reasoning-disable workaround, no sampling clamp, no hidden raw-output cleanup as runtime proof, no fake metadata guards, no package/sign/notarize/tag/download while runtime/model/UI/cache blockers are open.
- Active rows captured: Responses streaming tool args; MiniMax random Chinese/visible planning under cache; MiMo V2.5 JANGTQ2/JANG_2L exactness/tools/cache/media/UI; N2/Qwen JANG/JANGTQ live proof; DSV4 native composite cache/tool loop; Gemma4 media/cache/UI matrix; Step3.7 VLM/tool dialect/loop behavior; structured JSON/XML repair vs guided decoding; UI/CLI parity; release gate.
- Immediate split: Agent A raw SSE local-vs-tunnel Responses args, Agent B MiniMax cache/planning isolation with model-owned defaults, Agent C MiMo/N2 live runtime proof rows.
- No source commit or release action was part of this coordination write.

# 2026-06-07 - MiMo V2.5 JANG_2L speed root cause narrowed

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no ADLab, no
  deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, no Swift, no release packaging.
- Added MiMo affine SwitchGLU fast-path activation counters/logs and unit proof.
- Focused validation passed:
  `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile vmlx_engine/models/mllm.py tests/test_engine_audit.py`
  and
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_engine_audit.py -k 'mimo_v2_affine_switchglu_fast_path or inference_mode_reaches_mimo or runtime_quantizes_passthrough_decode_hotspots or mllm_mimo_v2_quantizes_python_list_decoder_layers or mllm_mimo_v2_turboquant_skip or mllm_mimo_v2_compiled_router'`
  -> `7 passed, 531 deselected`.
- Live source speed gate:
  `build/current-decode-speed-live-mimo-v25-jang2l-source-after-fastpath-counters-20260607.json`
  -> `status=review`, exact coherency passed, PP `78.41/106.43 tok/s`,
  bundle decode `1.79 tok/s`, greedy `1.83 tok/s`.
- Live log proved the runtime path installed and hit the affine SwitchGLU fast
  path: counters reached `calls=4096`, `compiled_shapes=2`.
- Decode trace proved Python/model step construction is not the remaining speed
  bottleneck: `last_step_ms` about `2-3 ms`, while async GPU/Metal completion
  stayed about `503-597 ms/token`.
- Current model bundle issue remains real: no local `jang_config.json`, and
  `lm_head`/`embed_tokens` are bf16 without intended 8-bit affine sidecars.
  Runtime-quantizing those two modules only moved decode into the same
  `1.7-1.8 tok/s` range, so re-export alone is not enough evidence for
  `40 tok/s`.
- Current classification: MiMo speed remains release-red and primarily
  runtime/kernel-side unless a corrected bundle disproves it. Likely real fix is
  fused affine/JANG expert decode or a MiMo JANGTQ/TurboQuant fused path, not
  top-k, sink disabling, generic TQ-KV, or a fake guard.
- Updated the MiMo no-heavy current-audit harness to consume the latest
  decode-speed artifact and refreshed proof pointers in the release manifest and
  objective summary.
- Deleted stale local HF remote-code cache only:
  `/Users/eric/.cache/huggingface/modules/transformers_modules/MiMo_hyphen_V2_dot_5_hyphen_JANG_2L`.
- Refreshed audit:
  `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-current-audit-after-fastpath-speed-proof-stale-clean-20260607.json`
  -> `status=open`, `stale_local_state_absent=true`.
- Remaining MiMo blockers from that audit: long-prompt coherence, tool
  protocol, decode speed, CB working-set pressure, source-vs-quant, and
  VL/audio/video wiring.
- Focused pointer/audit validation passed:
  `8 passed, 300 deselected`.
- Refreshed no-heavy release manifest:
  `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-mimo-fastpath-speed-proof-20260607.json`.
  The command exited non-zero as expected because `prepackage_ready=false` and
  `release_ready=false`.
- Current manifest blockers still include MiMo runtime quality, MiniMax
  reporter/root cause, cross-family live multi-turn smoke, real Electron UI
  cross-family matrix, DSV4 long/code/file quality, packaged integrity, and
  signing/notarization. Do not package or release.
- Pushed `d8198029` to `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`:
  `Expose MiMo speed and media blockers`.
- Release manifest validator now exposes MiMo `decode_speed_target_blocked`,
  `cb_working_set_pressure_blocked`, `media_unwired`,
  `current_audit_blockers`, and `latest_decode_speed_evidence` instead of
  hiding them behind generic root-cause prose.

  and
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_release_regression_manifest.py -k 'mimo_v2_root_cause or runtime_quality_open or release_clearance'`
  -> `4 passed, 304 deselected`.
- Ran current DSV4 long/code exactness preflight without launching the model:

# 2026-05-24 20:57 PDT - API gateway single-model auto-switch audited

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no Swift and no
  deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx` work.
- Waited for the active current-suite runner to finish before gateway tests.
- Verified gateway single-model behavior:
  `npm test -- --run tests/api-gateway-single-model.behavior.test.ts tests/api-gateway-ollama-behavior.test.ts`
  from `panel/` -> `2 passed`, `8 tests passed`.
- Verified API-surface pins:
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_api_surface_contract.py`
  -> `3 passed`.
- Refreshed API-surface artifact:
  `build/current-api-surface-contract-20260524-single-model-auto-switch.json`
  -> `status=pass`, `failed=[]`, no missing panel markers,
  server `26 passed`, panel `83 passed`,
  `panel_gateway_single_model_auto_switch_streaming=true`.
- Release-manifest validation slice: `4 passed`.
- `git diff --check` clean.
- Release remains blocked by the current objective open rows; no release claim.

# 2026-05-24 20:52 PDT - Regression list preserved; current-suite collision documented

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no Swift and no
  deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx` work.
- Posted MAIL coordination preserving Eric's full regression list and warning
  that Gemma4 mixed-SWA app-engine speed remains below the 80 tok/s floor
  despite source/installed-app cache telemetry proving native `paged+mixed_swa`
  with generic TurboQuant KV off.
- Refreshed the max-output/context contract after API gateway source edits:
  `build/current-max-output-context-contract-20260524-after-dsv4-neutral-reppen.json`
  -> `status=pass`, `failed=[]`, engine `25 passed`, panel `54 passed`.
- Focused regression slice passed after proof/test normalization:
  `211 passed, 162 deselected`.
- Full current-suite refresh is blocked by active coordination churn: another
  runner rewrote the same proof-board constants and suite artifact pointer
  during refresh. Both
  `build/current-regression-suite-20260524-single-model-auto-switch-dsv4-exact.json`
  and
  `build/current-regression-suite-20260524-after-gemma4-mixed-swa-telemetry.json`
  currently show `status=open` with failed packaged-integrity/focused/manifest
  steps.
- Release remains blocked; do not claim clearance.

# 2026-05-24 20:05 PDT - Current-suite manifest self-reference fixed

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no Swift and no
  deprecated wrapper work.
- Root cause of the post-Gemma suite failure was not a model/proof regression:
  the current suite invoked `run_release_regression_manifest.py
  --require-current-proof-sweep` before overwriting the same current-suite
  artifact that the manifest validates, so stale failed steps could poison the
  next run.
- Added TDD coverage for the provisional-artifact behavior in
  `tests/test_current_regression_suite.py`.
- Patched `tests/cross_matrix/run_current_regression_suite.py` to build the
  suite summary in one helper, refresh `objective_digest` before the manifest,
  and write a provisional current-suite artifact immediately before the
  manifest step.
- Verification:
  - red test failed before patch with unexpected
    `current_suite_artifact_path`;
  - targeted tests after patch: `36 passed`;
  - current suite now passes with `failed_steps=[]`;
  - manifest `current_proof_sweep.status=pass`;
  - objective digest still has exactly three open rows: DSV4 default-cache tool
    loop, Gemma4 mixed-SWA speed, DSV4 long-output/code exactness;
  - `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Gemma4 speed note for the other lane: fresh bundled cache-hit probe remains
  below floor and runtime cache telemetry still shows generic live
  `TurboQuantKVCache`, so the heterogeneous/mixed-SWA fast path is not proven.

# 2026-05-24 19:41 PDT - Gemma4 speed blocker narrowed to runtime-contract mismatch

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no Swift and no
  deprecated wrapper work.
- Ran a fresh bundled Gemma4 cache-hit speed probe with longer output budget:
  `build/current-runtime-memory-stress-gemma4-26b-jang4m-chat-thinkingoff-cachehit-256-bundled-20260524.json`.
- Both Gemma4 requests hit cache but stayed below the 80 tok/s floor:
  `37.766 tok/s` for `paged+disk` and `43.696 tok/s` for `paged`.
- Output was visible English, so the probe did not reopen the Gemma4 language
  quality row.
- Found a proof/telemetry contradiction: health reports
  `native_cache.schema=mixed_swa_kv_v1`, but also
  `generic_turboquant_kv.enabled=true`, while logs show runtime cache layout
  as 30/30 `TurboQuantKVCache`.
- Updated objective proof so Gemma4 speed artifacts with generic live TQ KV no
  longer satisfy the mixed-SWA runtime-contract bit.
- Refreshed objective digest:
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260521.json` still has exactly the
  three open rows: DSV4 default-cache tool loop, Gemma4 mixed-SWA speed, and
  DSV4 long-output/code exactness.
- Verification: focused Gemma4 objective/manifest tests `3 passed`.
- Noted active DSV4 route exactness runner on port `52487`; avoided DSV4
  artifact/current-suite refresh while that lane is active.

# 2026-05-24 19:31 PDT - DSV4 cross-family smoke cleared with cache-hit proof

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no Swift and no
  deprecated wrapper work.
- Identified a harness gap in the first DSV4 smoke: visible output/recognition
  passed, but the repeat-cache prompt was below the 256-token DSV4 native block
  threshold and did not prove cache reuse.
- Added red/green coverage so DSV4 smoke uses native composite launch flags
  (`--dsv4-enable-prefix-cache`, paged block size `256`) and a deterministic
  long repeat-cache prefix while generic smoke rows keep the short prompt.
- Reran bundled DSV4 smoke:
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-dsv4-jangtq-k-tools-cache-20260606/summary.json`
  -> `pass`, exact ACK repeat, second repeat `cache_hit_tokens=3639` and
  `cache_hits=30`, recall, and `reasoning_on` visible `FINAL=OK`.
- Updated objective proof so every cross-family smoke family must show a cache
  hit; a DSV4 artifact with clean text but no cache hit now leaves the row open.
- Cross-family live smoke is now pass for `dsv4`, `gemma4`, `hy3`,
  `ling_bailing`, `minimax`, `nemotron`, `qwen36`, `zaya_text`, and `zaya_vl`.
- Remaining open rows are exactly DSV4 default-cache tool loop, Gemma4 mixed-SWA
  speed floor, and DSV4 long-output/code exactness.
- Verification: focused tests `122 passed`; packaged integrity
  `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-20260524-crossfamily-cleared-dsv4-open.json`
  `status=pass`; release manifest
  `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260524-crossfamily-cleared-dsv4-open.json`
  `status=pass current_proof_sweep=pass`; current suite
  `build/current-regression-suite-20260524-crossfamily-cleared-dsv4-open.json`
  `status=pass failed_steps=[]`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.

# 2026-05-24 19:20 PDT - Gemma4 all-local smoke covered

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no Swift and no
  deprecated wrapper work.
- Posted Eric's broad regression-gate reminder to `.agents/MAIL.md` so other
  lanes keep cache/prefix, runtime params, family recognition, parser behavior,
  wrong-language/gibberish, memory/OOM, VL/video, UI/API propagation, bundled
  Python/JANG tools, and Gemma4 mixed-SWA speed in scope.
- Ran bundled Gemma4 all-local smoke:
  `VMLINUX_BENCH_ISOLATED=1 VMLINUX_BENCH_PYTHON=panel/bundled-python/python/bin/python3.12 .venv/bin/python bench/all_local_model_smoke.py --models-root /Users/eric/models --only Gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-JANG_4M-CRACK --max-models 1 --port 8852 --load-timeout-s 600 --request-timeout-s 240 --out build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-26b-jang4m-crack-bundled-20260524`
- Existing proof-board Gemma artifact:
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-26b-crack-bundled-20260524/summary.json`
  and fresh duplicate artifact both pass with failures `[]`.
- Live checks: exact ACK cold/repeat, repeat cache `cache_hit_tokens=56`,
  multi-turn recall `color=blue and animal=cat`, `reasoning_on` visible
  `FINAL=OK`, image `Blue`, no-media `NONE`, repeat blue, changed red.
- Objective cross-family row now covers `gemma4`, `hy3`, `ling_bailing`,
  `minimax`, `nemotron`, `qwen36`, `zaya_text`, `zaya_vl`; still missing `dsv4`.
- After regenerating the digest, Gemma4 visible/language is pass only for the
  app-visible artifact
  `build/current-runtime-memory-stress-gemma4-26b-jang4m-responses-thinkingon-app-visible-512-nocache-20260524.json`;
  the unsafe explicit thinking-budget low-cap failures remain preserved in
  details as unsupported-budget diagnostics.
- Gemma4 remains separately open for mixed-SWA app-engine speed below the
  80 tok/s floor. Current expected open rows are DSV4 default-cache, Gemma4
  mixed-SWA speed, cross-family missing DSV4, and DSV4 exact-code quality.

# 2026-05-24 15:41 PDT

- Python guard worktree only; no Swift/wrapper work.
- Announced packaging/bundled-runtime audit lane in `.agents/MAIL.md`.
- Hardened packaged console-script shebang checks:
  release gate, bundled verifier, and bundle-script final sanity check now
  reject any remaining `#!*python*` shebang, not just known `/Users/` or
  `/Applications/vMLX.app` paths.
- Red/green proof:
  arbitrary absolute Python path `/private/var/.../python3` was accepted before
  the patch and rejected after.
- Found and fixed a proof-board overclaim:
  `summarize_objective_proof.py` was surfacing
  `code_file_written_exact=false` in details but not requiring it for
  `DSV4 default-cache multi-tool agent loop is proven`.
- The default-cache row now remains open when the generated code contains
  `THREE.WebRenderer()` instead of `THREE.WebGLRenderer()`.
- Updated expected current open rows for current-suite and packaged-integrity
  harnesses to the real two blockers.
- Verification:
  - focused shebang/package/current-suite/objective tests `51 passed`;
  - `npm run verify-bundled` pass;
  - packaged integrity
    `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-20260524-default-cache-live-review.json`
    pass, `failed=[]`;
  - current regression suite
    `build/current-regression-suite-20260524-default-cache-live-review.json`
    pass, `failed_steps=[]`;
  - `py_compile`, shell syntax, and `git diff --check` pass.
- Open rows remain exactly:
  `DSV4 default-cache multi-tool agent loop is proven` and
  `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`.

# 2026-05-24 15:26 PDT

- Python guard worktree only; no Swift/wrapper work.
- Announced a DSV4 proof-audit lane in `.agents/MAIL.md` before any live/server
  action.
- Current local RAM was too low for a responsible DSV4 launch:
  128 GB total, about 74 GB available, DSV4 JANGTQ-K directory about 80 GB.
  No DSV4 server ports `8892`, `8891`, or `8854` were listening.
- Found and fixed a live-probe harness gap in
  `tests/cross_matrix/run_dsv4_route_mode_code_exactness.py`:
  unlike the default-cache live runner, it lacked a memory preflight and could
  spawn DSV4 under unsafe RAM.
- Added red/green coverage:
  - preflight skip before `subprocess.Popen`;
  - skipped preflight artifacts return exit 0 from `main()`, preserving
    evidence/open-row state instead of turning RAM pressure into a harness
    failure.
- New artifact:
  `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-memory-preflight-20260524.json`
  -> `status=skipped`, `reason=insufficient_free_memory`,
  `required_available_gb=120.0`, selected case `chat_max`.
- Verification:
  - route/objective/release focused pytest `15 passed`;
  - current regression suite
    `build/current-regression-suite-20260524-default-cache-live-review.json`
    pass, `failed_steps=[]`;
  - `py_compile` pass;
  - `git diff --check` pass.
- Open rows remain exactly the two DSV4 rows:
  default-cache multi-tool exact proof and long-output/code quality clearance.

# 2026-05-24 15:05 PDT

- Python guard worktree only; no Swift, no deprecated wrapper, no live model
  lane.
- Latest live default-cache artifact remains
  `build/current-dsv4-default-cache-tool-loop/result.json` with
  `status=review`.
- Parser/tool-loop/cache plumbing is no longer the current failure in that
  artifact: the loop reaches `list_directory, write_file, write_file` and final
  `DONE`, with native DSV4 cache/prefix/paged/L2 checks true.
- Remaining mismatch is model/output exactness:
  `landing-p/scene.js` contains `THREE.WebRenderer()` instead of
  `THREE.WebGLRenderer()` and lacks the final semicolon.
- Objective digest now records expected/actual code plus missing/corrupt
  identifier details for the default-cache row.
- Release manifest now states that the default-cache live loop reaches three
  tools but still fails exact `WebGLRenderer` fidelity.
- During rerun, packaged integrity caught stale bundled
  `vmlx_engine/tool_parsers/dsml_tool_parser.py`; rebuilt
  `panel/bundled-python` from source and local JANG tools, then rewrote
  generated console-script shebangs.
- Verification:
  - `npm run verify-bundled` pass;
  - packaged integrity
    `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-20260524-default-cache-live-review.json`
    pass, `failed=[]`;
  - focused proof/default-cache pytest `127 passed`;
  - current regression suite
    `build/current-regression-suite-20260524-default-cache-live-review.json`
    pass, `failed_steps=[]`;
  - `py_compile` pass;
  - `git diff --check` pass.
- Open rows remain exactly:
  `DSV4 default-cache multi-tool agent loop is proven` and
  `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`.

# 2026-05-24 14:46 PDT

- Did not touch Swift or deprecated wrapper handoffs.
- Coordinated around the other agent's live `8892` DSV4 default-cache
  tool-loop lane; did not send competing model requests.
- Read the first `8892` artifact:
  - `status=review`;
  - native DSV4 cache active and cache hit observed;
  - only `list_directory, write_file` executed;
  - round 1 emitted `<｜DSML｜tool_c` as completed message text.
- Added red/green proof diagnostics:
  - red:
    `test_dsv4_default_cache_tool_loop_response_diagnostics_capture_incomplete_state`
    failed because `response_diagnostics` did not exist;
  - green: live gate now records per-round response status, incomplete
    details, and output-item status/finish/name fields;
  - red:
    `test_objective_proof_digest_surfaces_default_cache_tool_loop_round_diagnostics`
    failed because the objective row did not surface round diagnostics;
  - green: objective digest now includes round output text and response
    diagnostics for the DSV4 default-cache row.
- Read the second `8892` artifact after the other agent reran with
  `max_output_tokens=768`:
  - `status=review`;
  - native cache path and cache reuse pass;
  - `list_directory, write_file, write_file` and final `DONE` pass;
  - exact code still fails because the third `write_file` parsed to
    `path=" string="`, `content=" string="`.
- Reproduced current parser source locally against the raw `invuse` DSML shape:
  current source rejects canonical bogus `string=` args and repairs the raw
  DSML to `landing-p/scene.js`, so the live artifact reflects a still-open
  behavior/proof boundary rather than a release pass.
- Refreshed API/cache contract after DSML parser/test source drift:
  `build/current-api-cache-contract-proof-20260524-after-default-cache-live-review.json`
  -> `status=pass`.
- Updated current-suite artifact output paths to the current proof-board
  artifacts for API/cache, max-output/context, parser registry, generation
  defaults, model artifact format, native MTP, and packaged integrity.
- Verification:
  - focused tests:
    `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_objective_proof_digest.py tests/test_dsv4_default_cache_tool_loop_gate.py tests/test_current_regression_suite.py tests/test_packaged_integrity_contract.py -k 'objective_proof_digest or default_cache_tool_loop or current_regression_suite or packaged_integrity'`
    -> `104 passed`;
  - current suite:
    `build/current-regression-suite-20260524-default-cache-live-review.json`
    -> `status=pass`, `failed_steps=[]`, open rows exactly DSV4 default-cache
    tool-loop and DSV4 long-output/code quality;
  - `py_compile`: pass;
  - `git diff --check`: pass.

# 2026-05-24 14:29 PDT

  - packaged integrity known-open-row sync;
  - DSV4 quality-clearance fixture with referenced source gate artifacts.
- Ran focused proof/regression suite:

- Added `tests/test_mcp_policy_contract.py` as the red contract for MCP runner marker enforcement.
- Red run: `uv run --extra dev python -m pytest -q tests/test_mcp_policy_contract.py` failed because `run_mcp_policy_contract.py` had no `REQUIRED_MCP_POLICY_TEST_MARKERS`.
- Updated `run_mcp_policy_contract.py`:

- Red:
  - `build/current-parser-registry-contract-20260522-reasoning-dropdown-red.json`
  - marker missing.
- Gate fix:
  - parser registry contract now records

# 2026-05-22 05:03 PDT

- Re-read DSV4 quality artifacts:
  - `build/current-dsv4-long-output-quality-clearance-20260521.json`
  - `build/current-dsv4-identifier-count-ablation-20260521/result.json`
  - `build/current-production-family-audit-static-dsv4-20260522.json`
- Current evidence still points at exact identifier/code corruption on the
  local DSV4 artifact, not cache/tool/UI/parser wiring.
- Found important model-side distinction:
  - HeadBF16 probe is only a head/norm overlay.
  - Full converter high-precision lane is `DSV4_HIGH_PRECISION=1`, which
    preserves attention, shared experts, compressor/indexer, embed, and head.
- In `/Users/eric/jang`, added and pushed:
  - `496e223 test: pin dsv4 high precision rebuild lane`
  - JANG converter contract now pins full non-routed high-precision passthrough.
  - JANG runtime blocker doc now records that HeadBF16 overlay is not enough
    evidence and full rebuilt-artifact live gates remain required.
- Verification:
  - DSV4 converter contract -> `27 passed`, 2 warnings.
- vMLX release build/signing still not started.

# 2026-05-22 07:17 PDT - Qwen/Nemotron hybrid-cache gate

- Added required family rows for Qwen dense linear-attention hybrid cache,
  Qwen MoE text linear-attention hybrid cache, and base Nemotron-H hybrid
  registry classification.

# 2026-05-22 07:25 PDT - DSV4 release decision check

- Rebuilt objective proof digest:
  `build/current-objective-proof-digest-20260522-qwen-nemotron-hybrid-cache.json`.

# 2026-05-22 07:27 PDT - Max output nonsticky proof

- Added named max-output/context contract check:
  `new_chat_output_caps_are_not_inherited_or_made_sticky`.

  - max-output contract test failed before the check existed;
  - release manifest test failed before the new artifact/proof text was

# 2026-05-22 07:35 PDT - JANG-only MX matmul speed rows

- Added required row:
  `decode_speed_jang_only_mx_matmul_policy`.
- Added marker:
  `test_decode_speed_gate_jang_only_rows_keep_text_mx_matmul_launch_policy`.
- Red:

# 2026-05-22 07:41 PDT - Commit/push and release gate refresh

- Committed and pushed:
  - `a4e5eced test: pin jang-only speed launch policy`
- Verified:
  - focused family/manifest pytest: `3 passed`
  - post-push release surface:
    `build/current-release-surface-contract-20260522-post-jang-only-mx-matmul-policy.json`
    -> `status=pass`
  - umbrella:
    `build/current-regression-suite-20260522-post-jang-only-mx-matmul-policy.json`
    -> `status=pass`, `failed_steps=[]`, only open requirement is DSV4
    long-output/code/file-generation quality clearance
- Release action remains held until Eric explicitly descopes that DSV4 quality
  claim or a rebuilt/source-equivalent DSV4 body passes the live gates.

# 2026-05-22 07:45 PDT - Direct release gate objective digest enforcement

- Added release-gate enforcement for objective proof digest.
- Red tests:
  - objective digest fail-on-open requirement
  - static release gate must call objective digest checker
  - manifest must index objective-gate-enforced packaged-integrity artifact
- Green:
  - `tests/test_release_gate_python_app.py` -> `36 passed`
  - clean-JANG packaged integrity -> `status=pass`, `failed=[]`
  - release gate now returns rc=1 with only:
    `objective proof digest: DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`
- No build/signing started.

# 2026-05-22 07:52 PDT - Persisted chat output cap guard

- Added red/green guard for persisted chat maxTokens vs server startup
  maxTokens.
- Red: max-output/context gate failed with missing marker.
- Green:
  - focused panel marker tests -> `3 passed`
  - max-output/context gate -> `status=pass`, `missing_markers=[]`
  - focused manifest/contract tests -> `2 passed`

# 2026-05-22 08:00 PDT - Persisted chat output cap checkpoint committed/pushed

- Commit:
  - `6de1134e test: pin persisted chat output cap isolation`
  - pushed to `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`
- Post-push gates:
  - release surface:
    `build/current-release-surface-contract-20260522-post-persisted-chat-output-cap.json`
    -> `status=pass`
  - umbrella:
    `build/current-regression-suite-20260522-post-persisted-chat-output-cap.json`
    -> `status=pass`, `failed_steps=[]`, only open requirement:
    `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`
  - direct release gate:
    `panel/scripts/release-gate-python-app.py --skip-app --skip-gui`
    -> rc=1 because objective digest still has the DSV4 quality row open
- Interpretation:
  - max-output/context/server-chat persisted-state wiring is guarded;
  - release cannot honestly proceed as fully cleared until DSV4 quality is
    fixed or Eric explicitly ships with that limitation documented.

# 2026-05-22 08:11 PDT

- Fixed DSV4 renderer command-preview filtering so stale `additionalArgs`
  cannot reenable Native MTP/deterministic MTP/default sampler/max-token/DSV4
  cache override flags that the main launch path blocks.
- Added permanent marker:
  `DSV4 additional args cannot reenable native MTP or deterministic sampling policy`.
- Verified:
  - focused settings-flow -> `3 passed / 231 skipped`;
  - native-MTP contract -> `status=pass`;
  - focused pytest -> `66 passed`;
  - release manifest -> 18 rows;
  - umbrella -> `status=pass`, `failed_steps=[]`, open requirement only
    `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`;
  - `git diff --check` clean.

# 2026-05-22 08:16 PDT

- Committed and pushed:
  - `79f14837 fix: block stale dsv4 native mtp args`
- Post-push release surface:
  - `build/current-release-surface-contract-20260522-post-dsv4-additional-args.json`
    -> `status=pass`
- Post-push umbrella:
  - `build/current-regression-suite-20260522-post-dsv4-additional-args.json`
    -> `status=pass`, `failed_steps=[]`
  - open requirement remains exactly:
    `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`

# 2026-05-22 08:18 PDT

- Direct release gate initially failed bundled-python import/hash parity because
  bundled `jang_tools/convert_hy3_jangtq.py` was stale.
- Rebuilt `panel/bundled-python` from current local vMLX and clean release JANG
  worktree.
- Verified:
  - `npm --prefix panel run verify-bundled` -> pass;
  - direct release gate summary
    `docs/internal/release-gates/20260522_081735/SUMMARY.md`:
    all non-app checks pass except objective digest, which fails only on
    `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`.
- Tracked branch clean after the pushed DSV4 additionalArgs commit; bundle and
  gate logs are ignored generated state.

# 2026-05-22 08:21 PDT

- Checked remaining DSV4 quality row:
  - sibling missing artifacts exist but are failing evidence, not clearance;
  - local DSV4-K/JANG/HeadBF16 probe all have F32 critical controls and pass
    YaRN rope-scaling validator;
  - DSV4-K routed plan remains the 0/1/2/23/25/28/34/36 mixed 2/4-bit plan.
- Found JANG clean-worktree hygiene issue:
  - `_internal/jang_v3` helper files are untracked in `/Users/eric/jang` main
    and absent from clean release worktree;
  - JANG DSV4 batch: `29 passed, 3 failed`, all three due to missing helper.
- Updated JANG blocker note:
  `/Users/eric/jang/docs/runtime/2026-05-22-dsv4-vmlx-live-quality-blocker.md`.

# 2026-05-22 08:32 PDT

- Fixed JANG `.gitignore` so clean worktrees can track only the DSV4 V3 helper
  files required by `test_jang_v3_dsv4_contract.py`.
- Verified in `/Users/eric/jang`:
  - V3 helper contract -> `3 passed`;
  - DSV4 converter/rope/hc batch -> `30 passed, 2 warnings`.
- Updated JANG DSV4/vMLX blocker note with the fix and proof.

# 2026-05-22 08:36 PDT

- Pushed JANG commit:
  - `09ca9a8 test: track dsv4 v3 helper contracts`
- Updated release-clean JANG source to `09ca9a8`.
- Verified:
  - temp clean worktree DSV4 V3 + converter/rope/hc batch:
    `33 passed, 2 warnings`;
  - release-clean V3 contract: `3 passed`;
  - vMLX `verify-bundled`: pass;
  - vMLX direct release gate:
    all non-app checks pass except known DSV4 objective digest row.

- 2026-05-22 08:30 PDT request-output/context isolation audit: max-output contract pass at build/current-max-output-context-contract-20260522-request-output-isolation-audit.json; no code changes.

- 2026-05-22 08:38 PDT fixed release harness clean-JANG-source env propagation; packaged integrity and umbrella suite pass with only known DSV4 quality open requirement.

- 2026-05-22 08:39 PDT pushed 40f0ec1b clean-JANG source release harness; release still waits on DSV4 long-output/code quality decision.

- 2026-05-22 08:40 PDT direct clean-source release gate passes all packaging checks and fails only DSV4 long-output/code quality objective.

- 2026-05-22 08:46 PDT added family-contract panel launch wiring row and proof artifact; umbrella suite still passes with only DSV4 quality open.

- 2026-05-22 08:47 PDT pushed 35875d3d panel launch family wiring guard; branch clean, release still blocked only by DSV4 quality row.

- 2026-05-22 08:53 PDT strengthened cache architecture gate with panel launch cache-policy coverage. New artifact `build/current-cache-architecture-contract-20260522-panel-cache-launch.json` passes with engine/API cache rows plus `panel_cache_launch_policy` at 75 passed / 168 skipped. Release manifest refreshed at `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260522-panel-cache-launch.json`. Umbrella refreshed at `build/current-regression-suite-20260522-panel-cache-launch.json` -> status=pass, failed_steps=[]; still no DSV4 live long-output/code clearance.

- 2026-05-22 08:59 PDT tightened max-output/context gate so Responses-specific per-chat `maxTokens` below/above server startup default and Responses Auto omission are required markers. New artifact `build/current-max-output-context-contract-20260522-responses-output-boundary.json` -> status=pass, engine 20 passed, panel 39 passed / 293 skipped. Release manifest refreshed at `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260522-responses-output-boundary.json`; umbrella refreshed at `build/current-regression-suite-20260522-responses-output-boundary.json` -> status=pass, failed_steps=[].

- 2026-05-22 09:05 PDT strengthened model-family gate with required rows for ZAYA1-VL JANGTQ_K/JANGTQ2/JANGTQ4 qwen3/VL/CCA policy, Hy3 JANGTQ_K Hunyuan+qwen3 Low/High policy, and affine-JANG Qwen native-MTP VL/video multimodal detection. New artifact `build/current-model-family-detection-contract-20260522-zaya-hy3-qwen-vl-profile-rows.json` -> status=pass, missing_rows=[]; release manifest refreshed at `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260522-zaya-hy3-qwen-vl-profile-rows.json`; umbrella refreshed at `build/current-regression-suite-20260522-zaya-hy3-qwen-vl-profile-rows.json` -> status=pass, failed_steps=[].

- 2026-05-22 09:11 PDT tightened parser registry gate with non-reasoning boundaries for Qwen2, Qwen2-VL, Gemma 3, and GLM base/Flash separation. New artifact `build/current-parser-registry-contract-20260522-non-reasoning-boundaries.json` -> status=pass, missing_markers=[], engine 120 passed, panel 40 passed. Release manifest refreshed at `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260522-non-reasoning-boundaries.json`; umbrella refreshed at `build/current-regression-suite-20260522-non-reasoning-boundaries.json` -> status=pass, failed_steps=[].

- 2026-05-22 09:17 PDT pre-DMG release gate rerun from `codex/pr-intake-manifest` at `09ae8c92`: version triple, twine check, panel request/type tests, panel typecheck, bundled Python import gate, and objective digest refresh passed. Gate failed only on the known objective row `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`; packaged app checks were skipped because DMGs/apps have not been built yet. Summary: `docs/internal/release-gates/20260522_091708/SUMMARY.md`. Eric explicitly asked to proceed to release DMG despite this known DSV4 quality exception; do not represent that row as cleared.

- 2026-05-22 10:12 PDT shipped v1.5.47. Pushed source/tag at `4fdd440e60b75aebd9ff71087fb89c1240a4c30a`, released Sequoia/Tahoe signed-notarized-stapled DMGs to both `jjang-ai/mlxstudio` and `jjang-ai/vmlx`, pushed mlxstudio updater commit `ec59aa3`, uploaded `vmlx==1.5.47` to PyPI after GitHub Publish PyPI workflow failed due missing trusted publisher/API secret, installed Sequoia DMG into `/Applications/vMLX.app`, verified installed app version/codesign/Gatekeeper, and opened it. Packaged gate `docs/internal/release-gates/20260522_100035/SUMMARY.md` still fails only the known `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared` objective row; this remains a release exception, not a clearance.

- 2026-05-22 10:22 PDT added post-release hardening proof for request output caps not mutating server startup defaults, plus fixed release-surface contract to accept complete post-release updater state. Red max-output artifact failed only missing the new marker; green max-output artifact `build/current-max-output-context-contract-20260522-request-default-mutation.json` passed. Red umbrella artifact exposed `release_surface_contracts`; green release-surface artifact `build/current-release-surface-contract-20260522-post-release-updater.json` passed. Final umbrella `build/current-regression-suite-20260522-post-release-updater.json` passed with `failed_steps=[]` and only the known DSV4 quality requirement open.

- 2026-05-22 10:24 PDT committed and pushed `d67fd5de test: harden post-release output and updater gates` to `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest` and `origin/main`.

- 2026-05-22 10:28 PDT added local high-risk artifact registry guard for actual DSV4, Qwen JANG/JANGTQ/MXFP/4bit/MTP, Hy3, and Nemotron Omni/Nano JANGTQ/MXFP rows. Red model-family artifact failed only missing the new row; green model-family artifact `build/current-model-family-detection-contract-20260522-local-artifact-registry.json` passed. Umbrella `build/current-regression-suite-20260522-local-artifact-registry.json` passed with `failed_steps=[]` and only the known DSV4 quality requirement open.

- 2026-05-22 10:31 PDT committed and pushed `b3894c48 test: pin local high-risk family registry rows` to `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest` and `origin/main`.

- 2026-05-22 10:49 PDT added panel local high-risk path parity and fixed real Qwen native-MTP VL registry mismatch. `qwen27_jang4m_mtp` now aligns engine/decode-speed policy with panel/API and emits `--is-mllm` only for indexed native-MTP VL artifacts with real vision/MTP tensors; plain affine-JANG Qwen VL remains text-only. Green artifacts: `build/current-model-family-detection-contract-20260522-panel-local-paths.json`, `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260522-panel-local-paths.json`, `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-20260522-panel-local-paths.json`, and `build/current-regression-suite-20260522-panel-local-paths.json` (`status=pass`, `failed_steps=[]`, only known DSV4 quality row open). Bundled Python was refreshed from clean JANG source after the release gate correctly caught source/bundle drift.

- 2026-05-22 10:51 PDT committed and pushed `64d259c5 fix: align qwen native mtp vl registry routing` to `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest` and `origin/main`.

- 2026-05-22 11:04 PDT bumped to v1.5.48 and built local Sequoia/Tahoe DMGs. Sequoia sha256 `8637edbdcb261729c8013878ef606643915661ddd6c46a368d952d620efe9d6d`; Tahoe sha256 `79adfba392ca534266acfad080718d6a392204c9f1ee60b831698c57a4edfedc`. Bundled verifier, packaged integrity, release-surface pre-release, focused release tests, and umbrella passed; umbrella still has only known DSV4 quality row open. Public release is blocked because electron-builder skipped notarization and the notary keychain/profile is locked; do not upload/tag/update latest until notarization/stapling/Gatekeeper validation is complete.

- 2026-05-22 11:06 PDT committed and pushed `c21a12d6 chore: prepare v1.5.48 release` to `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest` and `origin/main`.

- 2026-05-22 12:04 PDT isolated DSV4 pool-quant slowdown. Source no-prefix DSV4 speed gate is ~21.6-22.7 tok/s; native prefix/paged/L2 with `DSV4_POOL_QUANT=0` is 384 completion tokens in 37.18s (10.33 tok/s); same path with `DSV4_POOL_QUANT=1` is 384 completion tokens in 129.11s (2.97 tok/s). Default-cache tool loop with pool quant on passed functionally but was slow. Root cause read: `jang_tools/dsv4/pool_quant_cache.py` repeatedly dequantizes and requantizes the accumulated CSA/HCA pool every decode step. Added app guard so DSV4 launches always emit `DSV4_POOL_QUANT=0`, stale saved `dsv4PoolQuant` is cleared, and UI disables the pool-quant checkbox. Verification: focused panel pool tests `8 passed`, DSV4 cache policy tests `6 passed`, no-heavy panel settings contract pass at `build/current-panel-settings-contract-20260522-dsv4-pool-quant-disabled.json`.
# 2026-05-22 12:16 PDT

- Investigated DSV4 native prefix/cache + pool-quant slowdown against the real
  JANG source.
- Added and passed a JANG regression proving pool quant appends no longer
  requantize old rows.
- Installed local JANG source into this vMLX worktree venv and ran two live
  DSV4 raw-stream probes:
  - pool quant on, append-fixed: 192 deltas / 80.21s (~2.39 deltas/s);
  - pool quant off: 192 deltas / 29.87s (~6.43 deltas/s).
- Decision recorded: keep DSV4 pool quant disabled by default in vMLX; native
  unquantized DSV4 prefix/paged/L2 remains the viable cache path until JANG
  fixes full-pool dequantize/concat read cost.

# 2026-05-22 12:31 PDT

- Added vMLX no-heavy cache regression requiring bundled JANG DSV4 pool quant
  to append only new CSA/HCA pool rows.
- Green cache artifact:
  `build/current-cache-architecture-contract-20260522-dsv4-pool-quant-append.json`
  -> `status=pass`, cache family `107 passed`, panel cache launch `76 passed`.
- Refreshed bundled Python from clean JANG worktree
  `/Users/eric/jang/.worktrees/vmlx-release-clean-49e558e` at JANG commit
  `49e558e` because packaged integrity caught stale bundled
  `vmlx_engine/scheduler.py`.
- Verified bundled Python, packaged integrity, and umbrella:
  `build/current-regression-suite-20260522-dsv4-pool-quant-append-after-bundle.json`
  -> `status=pass`, `failed_steps=[]`, only known DSV4 long-output/code
  quality requirement open.
- Committed and pushed `608f105d test: require dsv4 pool quant append codec`
  to `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest` and `origin/main`.

# 2026-05-22 12:38 PDT

- Added max-output/context gate coverage for chat reset and string-shaped
  legacy persisted `maxTokens`.
- Red artifact:
  `build/current-max-output-context-contract-20260522-reset-policy-red.json`
  -> failed only missing `clears string legacy session maxTokens before launch
  can reuse it`.
- Green max-output artifact:
  `build/current-max-output-context-contract-20260522-reset-policy-string-legacy.json`
  -> `status=pass`, engine `21 passed`, panel `43 passed`.
- Umbrella:
  `build/current-regression-suite-20260522-reset-policy-string-legacy.json`
  -> `status=pass`, `failed_steps=[]`, only known DSV4 long-output/code
  quality requirement open.
- Committed and pushed `cd3efa84 test: harden max output reset migration`
  to `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest` and `origin/main`.

# 2026-05-23 12:05 PDT

- Reviewed the just-pushed duplicate DSV4 cache UI cleanup.
- Found a semantic regression: the remaining `DSV4 CSA/HCA Pool Codec`
  checkbox could set `dsv4PoolQuant` without enabling `dsv4PrefixCache`, even
  though launch emits `DSV4_POOL_QUANT=1` only when both are true and session
  normalization clears pool quant when prefix is off.
- Restored `cacheControlUpdatesForDsv4PoolQuantToggle` on the single pool
  checkbox, keeping the duplicate UI cleanup while making the checkbox create a
  launchable pool-on state.
- Updated the tooltip and stale Python-side DSV4 UI assertions.
- Verification: red `dsv4-env` proof first, panel focused 271 tests pass,
  panel typecheck pass, DSV4 Python UI/cache focused 3 pass, cache architecture
  contract pass with cache-family 111 and panel cache launch 92.
- Committed and pushed `5fa84203 fix: make dsv4 pool codec toggle launchable`
  to `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest` and `origin/main`.
- Post-push current suite source-of-truth:
  `build/current-regression-suite-20260523-after-pool-ui.json` ->
  `status=pass`, `failed_steps=[]`, with the same two open requirements:
  Qwen 27B JANG_4M PP speed and DSV4 long-output/code quality.
- Direct packaged integrity refresh:
  `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-20260523-dsv4-pool-ui-launchable.json`
  -> `status=pass`, `failed=[]`.

# 2026-05-23 12:16 PDT

- Ran installed DSV4 live cache-context identifier probe on
  `127.0.0.1:8008`; no new model launch.
- Artifact:
  `build/current-dsv4-live-cache-context-identifier-probe-20260523.json`.
- Native DSV4 composite cache, prefix/paged/block-L2, and pool quant were
  active; generic TurboQuant KV was off.
- Finding: unique prompt prefix did not prevent identifier corruption.
  `list_plain` produced `THIVE.WebGLRenderer`; `list_unique_prefix` produced
  `THUEE.WebGLRenderer`; constructor prompt preserved
  `THREE.PerspectiveCamera`.
- Wired result into objective proof as
  `current_installed_unique_prefix_identifier_probe`.
- Verification: red digest test first, then focused green; full
  `tests/test_objective_proof_digest.py tests/test_current_regression_suite.py`
  -> 61 passed; digest
  `build/current-objective-proof-digest-20260523-dsv4-cache-context-wired.json`
  keeps DSV4 quality open with unique-prefix probe status review.
- Committed and pushed `e684f5d5 test: surface dsv4 unique-prefix identifier probe`
  to `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest` and `origin/main`.
- `4185a2b6 test: gate packaged dsv4 cache ui labels` landed underneath it
  from the other agent while this slice was being finalized.

# 2026-05-23 12:42 PDT

- Added packaged-integrity enforcement for Max Thinking Tokens renderer and
  request/DB wiring markers.
- Verified repo-local packaged app bundle launch after ad-hoc signing nested
  native libraries.
- Live boundary proof:
  - running app opened `~/Library/Application Support/vmlx/chats.db` with
    `chat_overrides.max_thinking_tokens`;
  - packaged `app.asar` contains UI, DB, sanitizer, request, and defaults
    wiring;
  - packaged bundled Python accepts positive `max_thinking_tokens` and rejects
    zero for Chat/Responses.
- Verification:
  - packaged integrity pass;
  - max-output/context pass;
  - panel focused settings/request/defaults `322 passed`;
  - Python focused server/API/max-output/package `43 passed`;
  - panel typecheck pass.
- Pushed `2fb4dda0 test: gate packaged max thinking setting` to
  `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest` and `origin/main`.
- Boundary: Computer Use could not attach to vMLX UI, so proof is process/DB/
  packaged-renderer/API-model rather than a clicked screenshot; no heavy model
  launch in this slice.

# 2026-05-23 12:52 PDT

- Fixed repo-local/dev app user-data isolation:
  - added early bootstrap for `--vmlx-user-data-dir`, `VMLX_USER_DATA_DIR`, and
    legacy `VMLINUX_USER_DATA_DIR`;
  - bootstrap runs before DB construction and before
    `app.requestSingleInstanceLock()`.
- Added source regression and packaged-integrity gate for the bootstrap.
- Live packaged proof:
  - rebuilt and packaged `panel/release/mac-arm64/vMLX.app`;
  - launched isolated data dirs under `build/user-data-isolation-smoke*`;
  - each got its own `chats.db`; the real app-support DB stayed unchanged in
    the second clean smoke.
- Verification:
  - user-data isolation test `3 passed`;
  - panel typecheck pass;
  - build/package pass with `CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false`;
  - packaged integrity pass;
  - panel focused settings/request/defaults `322 passed`;
  - Python packaged/max-output focused `13 passed`.
- First umbrella run exposed an unrelated objective-fixture gap: synthetic
  DSV4 clearance did not create the source no-cache identifier artifact now
  required by the digest, so focused regression failed.
- Fixed that fixture; focused digest/current-suite tests `62 passed`.
- Umbrella rerun:
  `build/current-regression-suite-20260523-user-data-isolation2.json` ->
  `status=pass`, `failed_steps=[]`, with Qwen PP speed and DSV4 quality still
  open.
- Pushed `5cf44107 fix: isolate repo-local app user data` to
  `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest` and `origin/main`.
- Observed live DSV4 probes on ports `8844` then `8845`; left them untouched.

## [2026-05-23 13:39] codex | package+smoke | clean-JANG dev app package usable; release blockers remain

- Rebuilt bundled Python from clean JANG worktree
  `/Users/eric/jang/.worktrees/vmlx-release-clean-b5f66a7/jang-tools`.
- Verified bundled Python passed and packaged `panel/release/mac-arm64/vMLX.app`
  with `CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false`.
- Ad-hoc signed and smoke-launched the repo-local app with isolated user data:
  `build/final-user-data-smoke-clean-20260523`.
- Smoke log proved isolated userData, no engine adoption, bundled
  `vmlx_engine 1.5.48`, gateway start, updater v1.5.48, and isolated
  `chats.db` creation.
- Packaged integrity verifier is clean for bundle parity, but release gate still
  fails objective proof digest on Qwen PP speed and DSV4 long-code quality.
- Qwen follow-up live rows remain `review`, including disabled-native-MTP;
  do not mark Qwen PP cleared.
## [2026-05-23 15:54] codex | qwen-mtp-proof | Qwen VLM+MTP source/native cleared; strict proof sweep restored

- Used the post norm-format Qwen VLM+MTP live artifact as the source/native
  clearance row.
- Updated objective/manifest/current-suite gates so Qwen is no longer a
  known-open requirement; DSV4 long-output/code quality remains the only open
  objective.
- Kept `--require-current-proof-sweep` in the umbrella and added a narrow
  release-manifest bootstrap allowance for the manifest self-reference cycle.
- Verification: strict umbrella pass, manifest proof sweep pass, focused
  current-suite/manifest tests pass, Qwen/native-MTP/objective slices pass,
  `py_compile` pass, `git diff --check` pass.

## [2026-05-23 16:01] codex | dsv4-audit | present affine row + sampling risk visibility

- Fixed stale production-family audit row `dsv4_jang_dq2_gate3math6`, which
  pointed at a missing local DSV4 path.
- The row now points at the present local affine NoMTP artifact:
  `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-JANG`.
- Added static `sampling_loop_risk` audit output so model-owned max-output and
  sampler gaps are visible without adding hidden runtime defaults.
- Verification: changed focused tests `4 passed`; broader DSV4/model-family
  slice `34 passed, 59 deselected`; model-family contract pass with
  `missing_rows=[]`; production-family static DSV4 artifact has both affine
  rows `exists=true`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` pass.
- Boundary: DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality remains open.
- Pushed `f702f537 test: align dsv4 affine audit row` to
  `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.

## [2026-05-23 16:08] codex | family-audit | summary exposes missing/review rows

- Added `production_family_audit_summary()` to the static/live family audit
  runner.
- Refreshed
  `build/current-production-family-static-loop-risk-audit-20260523.json`.
- Current no-heavy matrix summary: 32 rows, 7 missing rows, 10 issue rows, 29
  sampling-review rows, no live rows in this run.
- Missing rows currently include stale/unavailable DSV4, Qwen35 JANGTQ4,
  Mistral, and MiniMax JANGTQ4 paths on `/Volumes/EricsLLMDrive`.
- Verification: summary/sampling focused tests `3 passed`, `py_compile` pass,
  `git diff --check` pass.
- Left unrelated dirty Ling/Bailing Native-MTP guard edits untouched.
- Pushed `f1231aeb test: summarize production family audit gaps` to
  `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.

## [2026-05-23 16:13] codex | minimax-live | loop trigger added and small row passed

- Found the first MiniMax small live artifact was a generic API/cache/parser
  pass, not a real loop/gibberish trigger despite its filename.
- Added a live loop probe selector so MiniMax rows run
  `minimax_multilingual_loop_trigger`; Ling keeps its existing loop trigger.
- Reran `minimax_m27_small_tq` live:
  `build/current-production-family-live-minimax-small-loop-audit-20260523-rerun.json`.
- Result: `live.status=PASS`, `failures=[]`, 12 checks including the new
  MiniMax loop trigger.
- Loop trigger evidence: `finish=stop`, no reasoning, `loop_score=0.0571`,
  `cjk_chars=0`, `word_count=54`.
- Verification: py_compile pass, focused loop/summary tests `4 passed`,
  `git diff --check` pass; no MiniMax process left on port 8797.
- Commit split pushed:
  `6cdb67ea test: require live loop probes for ling minimax` and
  `79fb6143 test: add minimax live loop trigger`.
## [2026-05-23 16:18] codex | live-family-audit | Hy3 preview loop probe current

- Ran `hy3_preview_jangtq2` live production-family audit after the harness
  gained `hy3_multilingual_loop_trigger`.
- Artifact:
  `build/current-production-family-live-hy3-jangtq2-loop-audit-20260523.json`.
- Result: `live_status_counts={"PASS":1}`, `missing_rows=[]`,
  `issue_rows=[]`, failed live checks none.
- Loop trigger passed with `finish=stop`, `content_chars=478`,
  `reasoning_chars=0`, `loop_score=0.0735`, `cjk_chars=0`, `word_count=52`.
- No model audit process remains.
- Boundary: source-engine Hy3 preview JANGTQ2 row only; does not clear other
  Hy3 rows, packaged app behavior, or DSV4 long-output/code quality.

## [2026-05-23 16:18] codex | live-family-audit | ZAYA text typed-cache row current

- Ran `zaya_jangtq2` live production-family audit.
- Artifact:
  `build/current-production-family-live-zaya-jangtq2-typed-cache-audit-20260523.json`.
- Result: `live_status_counts={"PASS":1}`, `missing_rows=[]`,
  `issue_rows=[]`, failed live checks none.
- ZAYA checks passed: `zaya_cca_typed_cache_live_gate_enabled`,
  `zaya_native_cache_capabilities`, `runtime_cache_layout_logged`,
  `cache_second_turn_coherent`.
- Native cache proved `schema=zaya_cca_v1`, `cache_type=typed_cca`,
  generic TurboQuant KV disabled, prefix/paged/block-disk L2 enabled.
- Repeat turn reported `cached_tokens=38`,
  `cache_detail=paged+zaya_cca`, and block disk L2 writes.
- No model audit process remains.
- Boundary: source-engine ZAYA text JANGTQ2 row only; does not clear ZAYA-VL,
  packaged app behavior, other ZAYA quant rows, or DSV4 long-output/code
  quality.

## [2026-05-23 16:18] codex | harness-tightening | ZAYA exact tool args now enforced

- Found the Responses auto-tool audit was too loose: it accepted any
  `list_directory` function call even when parsed arguments were malformed.
- Added `responses_tool_call_arguments_ok()` and a regression test requiring
  exact args `{"path":"."}` for the live audit probe.
- Red proof: new test failed before helper existed.
- Green proof: focused argument/markup tests `2 passed`; focused ZAYA/tool
  tests `8 passed, 58 deselected`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` pass.
- Strict live reruns:
  - ZAYA-VL JANGTQ4 now fails only auto-tool exact args:
    `{"path":"<value>.</value>"}`;
  - ZAYA text JANGTQ2 now defers only auto-tool exact args:
    `{"path":": "}`.
- Read: typed CCA cache is good; exact Responses auto-tool argument fidelity is
  still open for ZAYA/ZAYA-VL.
- Committed and pushed:
  `1aba1522 test: require exact responses tool args`.
## [2026-05-23 16:39] codex | qwen-live-fix | dense JANG quant/cache audit green

- Fixed Qwen3.6-27B JANG_4M source-engine live audit failure.
- Root causes:
  - stale mixed affine per-module claims were shape-compatible but wrong for
    hidden-size modules, producing 2560-wide embeddings against 5120-wide norms;
  - equal-length multi-prompt hybrid batches skipped cache `prepare()`, causing
    RoPE offset shape `(0)` in batched follow-up probes.
- Added/kept focused tests for Qwen architecture-dim quant inference,
  post-load embedding logical dims, and equal-length prompt-batch cache prepare.
- Authoritative artifact:
  `build/current-production-family-live-qwen36-dense-jang-quantfix-clean-audit-20260523.json`
  -> pass, failures=[].
- Earlier `quantfix-audit` artifact is invalid evidence because the server
  logged a port bind error and the audit reached a stale process.

## [2026-05-23 16:50] codex | zaya-tools | exact Responses tool args fixed

- Fixed ZAYA exact Responses auto-tool argument fidelity without changing
  samplers, cache policy, model detection, generation defaults, or settings.
- Root cause: ZAYA fallback XML examples still used `VALUE HERE` placeholders
  after live logs showed template schema injection was required; ZAYA-VL also
  emitted an extra `<value>...</value>` wrapper inside the parameter body.
- Changes:
  - unwrap ZAYA-only `<value>...</value>` inside `ZayaToolParser`;
  - render concrete XML fallback example values: `.` for path-like params,
    `example` for other string params.
- Proof:
  - focused parser/fallback/audit tests: `30 passed`;
  - `build/current-tool-call-contract-20260523-zaya-exact-toolargs.json`:
    `status=pass`, `failed=[]`, `missing_markers=[]`;
  - live `zaya_vl_jangtq4` strict rerun: `PASS`, exact
    `{"path":"."}`;
  - live `zaya_jangtq2` strict rerun: `PASS`, exact `{"path":"."}`;
  - other agent umbrella:
    `build/current-regression-suite-20260523-after-bundle-refresh.json` ->
    `status=pass`, `failed_steps=[]`, only DSV4 long-output/code quality open;
  - `git diff --check`: pass.
- Committed and pushed:
  `2c0fc8a4 fix: repair zaya tool argument examples`.

## [2026-05-23 20:34] codex | release-surface | public updater cache headers fixed

- SSH inspected `exploit.team`.
- Found `/var/www/mlxstudio` absent; actual root is `/var/www/mlx.studio`.
- Fixed `/etc/nginx/conf.d/mlx.studio.conf` where `location /update/` had
  been accidentally commented onto one line.
- Reloaded nginx after `nginx -t` passed.
- Public `https://mlx.studio/update/latest.json` now has no-store/no-cache
  headers and matches raw GitHub latest on 1.5.48 URL/SHA.
- Added live release-surface contract enforcement for updater cache headers.
- Verification: release-surface focused tests 12 passed; live public
  release-surface artifact pass; release regression manifest pass;
  `git diff --check` pass.
- Committed and pushed:
  `5336e8d5 test: guard public updater cache headers`.

## [2026-05-23 20:48] codex | live-agentic-runtime | qwen responses tool extraction fixed, cache/tool follow-up open

- Ran long live Responses/tool/cache probes against
  `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ/Qwen3.6-27B-JANG_4M`.
- Found non-streaming Responses endpoint bug:
  real Qwen `<tool_call>` markup inside reasoning was not parsed because only
  `content_for_parsing` was sent to the tool parser.
- Fixed `vmlx_engine/server.py` to parse real tool markers from
  `reasoning_text` before non-streaming Responses finalization.
- Added regression in `tests/test_engine_audit.py`.
- Proof:
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_engine_audit.py::TestResponsesSuppressedReasoningToolCalls -q`
  -> `2 passed`.
- Live after patch:
  `build/qwen36-dense-jang-responses-long-tool-cache-after-reasoning-tool-fix-20260523/gate-auto-thinking-on/SUMMARY.json`
  now shows turn 1 structured function_call `grep_repo`.
- Still open:
  tool-output follow-up can stay reasoning-only with thinking on; hybrid cache
  writes/L2 grow but varied previous_response_id turns do not get usable
  SSM-backed cached_tokens; MiniMax-small temp 0.6 multilingual loop remains;
  DSV4 long-output/code quality remains open.
- Durable details:
  `docs/internal/LIVE_AGENTIC_RUNTIME_AUDIT_2026-05-23.md`.
- Rebuilt bundled Python from this checkout with clean JANG source and verified
  source-content parity.
- Verification:
  - focused runtime/tool/history tests: `93 passed`;
  - `git diff --check`: pass;
  - packaged integrity:
    `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-20260523-live-agentic-runtime.json`
    -> `status=pass`, `failed=[]`;
  - umbrella:
    `build/current-regression-suite-20260523-live-agentic-runtime-after-bundle.json`
    -> `status=pass`, `failed_steps=[]`, only DSV4 long-output/code quality
    remains open.
- No model/test/release/notary process left running.
- Committed and pushed:
  `e9e6fca6 fix: parse responses tool calls from reasoning`.
- 2026-05-23 21:14 PDT rechecked DSV4 pool quant across actual runtime
  surfaces. Repo `.venv` and repo bundled Python both contain the materialized
  pool fix (`_pooled_materialized`, `append_pooled`); installed
  `/Applications/vMLX.app` is stale and lacks both. Inline same-sequence probe:
  repo `.venv` `dequant_count=0`, installed app `dequant_count=4`. Fresh
  focused checks: vMLX DSV4 pool/cache `4 passed`, JANG pool tests `3 passed`,
  cache architecture/API-cache/native-MTP/VL-media contracts all pass, umbrella
  `build/current-regression-suite-20260523-dsv4-pool-runtime-recheck.json`
  passes with `failed_steps=[]` and only known DSV4 long-output/code quality
  requirement open. Audit:
  `docs/internal/DSV4_POOL_QUANT_RUNTIME_AUDIT_2026-05-23.md`.

- 2026-05-23 21:33 PDT reconciled v1.5.49 DSV4 default-cache release policy:
  native composite prefix cache + materialized pool codec default on, explicit
  disable honored, generic KV q4/q8 suppressed. Fixed stale CLI/test
  diagnostic-off wording. Focused DSV4 policy/UI/pool slice `6 passed`;
  `build/current-cache-architecture-contract-20260523-v1549-release-rerun.json`
  passed with no failed or missing markers.

- 2026-05-23 21:35 PDT added Qwen VL/MTP retained-image Metal OOM guard:
  VLM media requests now tighten MLX reusable Metal cache before `mlx_vlm`
  preprocessing and before one-shot VLM forward. Focused VLM OOM/media tests
  `7 passed`; prompt/image guard tests `3 passed`; image-count audit `3 passed`;
  VL/media contract
  `build/current-vl-media-cache-contract-20260523-vlm-image-cache-limit.json`
  passed. Live source Qwen VL/MTP image smoke completed and logged media cache
  limit tightened to `1.00GB`. Pushed
  `58457129 fix: tighten vlm media metal cache headroom`.

- 2026-05-23 21:48 PDT refreshed bundled Python/JANG for v1.5.49 release gate.
  `verify-bundled-python.sh` passes; packaged integrity
  `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-20260523-v1549-final-local-jang.json`
  passes; release manifest
  `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260523-v1549-final-local-jang.json`
  has `current_proof_sweep=pass`. Release gate skip-app now fails only on the
  known DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation objective row.
## 2026-05-23 22:49 PDT - v1.5.49 signed DMG validation complete

- Validated both final public DMGs from mounted artifacts:
  - `panel/release/vMLX-1.5.49-sequoia-arm64.dmg`
    `96e693f2cb6a8c476eea079ca8537808a80b5bbc5550d3bf574e0550c00fb2c4`
  - `panel/release/vMLX-1.5.49-tahoe-arm64.dmg`
    `c121581907aa3adcfefa9f146f158745276823bc457e74fcc28bf9147fac2230`
- Each DMG passes stapler validation and Gatekeeper open assessment.
- Each mounted app reports version `1.5.49`, passes deep strict codesign
  verification, imports `vmlx_engine==1.5.49`, and contains the materialized
  DSV4 pool cache fix in bundled `jang_tools`.
- Remaining release exception is unchanged: DSV4 long-output/code exactness
  remains documented open.

## 2026-05-23 23:03 PDT - v1.5.49 public release complete

- Published `v1.5.49` on `jjang-ai/vmlx` and `jjang-ai/mlxstudio`.
- Uploaded Sequoia/Tahoe DMGs plus blockmaps to both releases.
- Uploaded PyPI `vmlx==1.5.49` wheel and sdist.
- Updated and verified both updater feeds:
  - raw GitHub `jjang-ai/mlxstudio/main/latest.json`;
  - `https://mlx.studio/update/latest.json`.
- Final public release-surface contract:
  `build/current-release-surface-contract-20260523-v1549-public-final2.json`
  -> `status=pass`.
- Installed `/Applications/vMLX.app` from the validated Sequoia DMG and opened
  it for manual testing.
- Installed-app verification passed version, codesign, Gatekeeper, bundled
  engine import, and bundled DSV4 materialized pool source check.

## [2026-05-24 19:53] codex | proof | DSV4 exact-code rail boundary wired

- Added current live DSV4 generated-only/direct and requested-thinking
  route-mode artifacts to objective digest and release manifest proof.
- Current direct/off subset remains failed with `WebWebGLRenderer` under
  `thinking_disabled`/`thinking_not_requested`; requested-thinking subset
  passes exact code.
- Added `current-dsv4-direct-vs-thinking-webgl-logit-probe-20260524.json`:
  `GL` is rank 1 after `THREE.Web` in both rails, but direct/off differs at
  `THREE.` and `THREE.P` where requested-thinking ranks the expected tokens
  first.
- Refreshed objective digest, current suite, and release manifest. Suite and
  manifest pass with exactly the three known open rows.
- No runtime force-on policy change was made.

## [2026-05-24 20:28] codex | gemma4 | mixed-swa runtime contract fixed, speed open

- Root cause: Gemma4 mixed sliding/full attention was previously flattened by
  generic live TurboQuant KV under `VMLINUX_FORCE_TQ_AUTO=1`, so health could
  claim `mixed_swa_kv_v1` while runtime used `30/30 TurboQuantKVCache`.
- Source fix: skip generic TQ patching for mixed sliding/full attention layouts
  and pass scheduler mixed-attention detection into `MLLMBatchGenerator`.
- Telemetry fix: mixed-SWA prefix hits now report `paged+mixed_swa` /
  `paged+mixed_swa+disk` instead of the generic hybrid SSM labels.
- Live installed-app proof:
  `build/current-runtime-memory-stress-gemma4-26b-jang4m-chat-thinkingoff-cachehit-256-installed-app-after-mixed-swa-telemetry-20260524.json`
  has `generic_turboquant_kv.enabled=false`, `cache_detail=paged+mixed_swa`,
  but speeds `59.933` / `54.992 tok/s`.
- Refreshed proof board:
  current suite `build/current-regression-suite-20260524-after-gemma4-mixed-swa-telemetry.json`
  passes, packaged integrity
  `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-20260524-after-gemma4-mixed-swa-telemetry.json`
  passes, release manifest
  `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260524-after-gemma4-mixed-swa-telemetry.json`
  has `current_proof_sweep=pass`.
- Do not release-clear: Gemma speed floor remains open and DSV4 still has two
  open objective rows.

## [2026-05-24 12:08] codex | risk | wrong-repo Swift detour corrected

- After context compaction I resumed from `/Users/eric/vmlx` and followed stale
  Swift handoff instructions instead of this Python coordination workspace.
- Stale `/Users/eric/vmlx` root handoff was deleted/replaced with a routing
  guard pointing back to `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx`.
- Do not use any `/Users/eric/vmlx` Swift notes as current app/runtime state.
  Current Python source of truth remains this worktree's `.agents` plus the
  latest build artifacts; DSV4 exact-code quality is the active release blocker.

## [2026-05-24 14:00] codex | fix | packaged drift and stale synthetic DSV4 fixture

- Fixed stale synthetic all-clear objective-proof fixture to include current
  DSV4 diagnostic evidence files.
- Reinstalled current local `vmlx` into `panel/bundled-python`, rewrote
  regenerated `vmlx*` console scripts to relocatable trampoline shebangs, and
  removed regenerated bytecode caches.
- Verified `npm run verify-bundled` passes.
- Verified
  `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-20260524-after-bundled-engine-sync2.json`
  has `status=pass`.
- Verified
  `build/current-regression-suite-20260524-after-bundled-engine-sync.json`
  has `status=pass`, `failed_steps=[]`, and the single open requirement remains
  `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`.
- Do not claim release cleared; the DSV4 exact-code/model-quality row remains
  intentionally open.

## [2026-05-24 12:14] codex | audit | DSV4 latest artifact still red

- Re-synced `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no active DSV4
  server/test process was visible.
- Latest live DSV4 route exactness artifact inspected:
  `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-source-after-completion-token-split-20260524.json`.
- Artifact status is still `fail`; `chat_max` corrupts Perspective/Box/Mesh
  identifiers and `legacy_completion_raw` corrupts `THREE.WebGLRenderer`.
- The artifact predates new requested/effective rail diagnostics, so it cannot
  prove live effective-rail behavior. Focused audit tests for the diagnostic
  split passed: `6 passed, 39 deselected`.

## [2026-05-24 12:22] codex | audit | no-heavy proof board refreshed

- Refreshed current no-heavy proof artifacts affected by `vmlx_engine/server.py`
  hash drift: API/cache, max-output/context, generation defaults, native MTP,
  and model artifact format all pass.
- Refreshed digest
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260524-codex-recheck.json` now has
  exactly one open row: DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality.
- DSV4 is still not release-cleared; latest live route exactness artifact is
  red.

## [2026-05-24 12:31] codex | live-probe | DSV4 rerun timeout

- Attempted live DSV4 route-mode exactness rerun on port `8861` using bundled
  Python and `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-JANGTQ-K`.
- Server reached health `model_loaded=true`, then the first HTTP request timed
  out. Runner exited with traceback and did not rewrite the target artifact.
- `8861` listener is gone; orphan PID `251` remains non-listening and resisted
  normal kill and `kill -9`.
- Separate DSV4 server on port `8886` was already present and was not touched.
- Current evidence: DSV4 remains open; route-mode rerun is timeout/inconclusive
  and older exactness artifact is still red.

## [2026-05-24 12:41] codex | live-probe | existing DSV4 server two-row failure

- Reused already-loaded DSV4 server on port `8886` for a tiny two-row probe to
  avoid another model load.
- Artifact:
  `build/current-dsv4-two-row-existing-server-8886-20260524.json`.
- Result `status=fail`.
- `chat_max` corrupts identifiers (`PersPerspectiveCamera`, `BBoxGeometry`,
  `MMeshBasicMaterial`) and returns a markdown fence.
- `legacy_completion_raw` fails exactness and produces malformed/prose-ish
  output with `PersontiveCamera`.
- After the client completed, `/health` still showed `scheduler.num_running=1`
  and `num_waiting=0` for at least 30 seconds. Possible scheduler liveness or
  accounting leak; `8886` was not killed.

## [2026-05-24 12:58] codex | fix-verify | DSV4 completions/fence cleanup source checks

- Current source routes DSV4 `/v1/completions` through `engine.chat(...)`,
  extracts visible DSV4 completion text, and unwraps a whole single markdown
  fence only for exact/no-markdown requests.
- Focused tests pass:
  `test_dsv4_completion_endpoint_uses_chat_rail` and
  `test_dsv4_completion_exact_no_markdown_returns_visible_unfenced_code` ->
  `2 passed, 78 deselected`.
- Broader DSV4/completion/logprobs slice passed: `38 passed, 89 deselected`.
- Refreshed no-heavy hash-tracked artifacts and objective digest; only open
  row remains DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality.
- Live DSV4 server on `8886` is active with `num_running=1`, so no competing
  live probe was started from this lane.

## [2026-05-24 13:04] codex | audit | DSV4 clearance gate hardened

- Found proof-board risk: route-mode exactness artifact was detail-only, not
  part of DSV4 release-clearance boolean.
- Updated `summarize_objective_proof.py` so DSV4 quality cannot pass unless the
  route-mode exactness artifact status is `pass`.
- Added regression test proving fenced/normalized-only route output keeps DSV4
  open even if the older quality-clearance artifact says pass.
- Verification: DSV4/quality proof slice `14 passed, 25 deselected`; refreshed
  digest still has only DSV4 quality open.

## [2026-05-24 12:43] codex | recovery | active Python lane rechecked after Swift detour

- Re-read `/Users/eric/vmlx` routing guard, active Python `AGENTS.md`, and this
  worktree's `.agents` state. Active app/runtime lane is
  `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; Swift remains out of scope.
- Current open blocker remains DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality.
  Do not claim the completions/fence cleanup fixed DSV4 until a fresh full live
  route-mode exactness artifact passes; latest live artifact still had
  `chat_max` and `legacy_completion_raw` failures.
- Process check: server `8886` PID `4692` is loaded and currently idle by
  `/health` (`num_running=0`, `num_waiting=0`), but live requests should still
  be coordinated through `MAIL.md` before use.

## [2026-05-24 12:44] codex | cleanup | stale Swift/handoff artifacts removed from wrapper repo

- Deleted stale `/Users/eric/vmlx` Swift/handoff docs and Swift build/test logs
  matched by `*swift*` or `*handoff*`.
- Verified the only remaining `swift`/`handoff`/agent-routing hits at maxdepth 3
  are `/Users/eric/vmlx/AGENTS.md` and `/Users/eric/vmlx/CODEX.md`, both routing
  guards pointing agents to the Python repo.
- No Swift engine/app source was used for current vMLX work.

## [2026-05-24 12:47] codex | audit-fix | DSV4 completion effective rail diagnostic corrected

- Found a route-mode proof bug: the DSV4 exactness dry-run/live artifact still
  described `/v1/completions` effective prompt rail as `none`/legacy raw, even
  though current source routes non-streaming DSV4 completions through
  `engine.chat(...)`.
- Added red/green coverage and updated the runner so completion requested rail
  stays `none` but effective rail records `thinking_open` with reason
  `dsv4_completion_chat_rail_identifier_unsafe`.
- Refreshed `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-dryrun-20260524.json`
  and `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260524-codex-recheck.json`.
- Verification: red test failed before fix; focused route/objective slice
  `8 passed, 38 deselected`; full route exactness unit file `7 passed`;
  `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed. No live request was sent to
  `8886`; DSV4 quality remains open.

## [2026-05-24 12:51] codex | audit-fix | scheduler running-request diagnostics added

- Backed off from live probing when `8886` flipped to `num_running=1` before the
  planned narrow request.
- Added prompt-free lifecycle diagnostics to `Scheduler.get_stats()` so
  `/health.scheduler` can expose running/waiting request IDs, pending abort IDs,
  and per-running-request status/age/token/cache/batch uid details after the
  next server restart.
- This is instrumentation for debugging the observed `num_running=1` aftermath,
  not a DSV4 output-quality fix. Current `8886` process predates the patch and
  therefore cannot show these fields.
- Verification: red test failed before fields existed; focused stats tests
  `2 passed`; scheduler/health lifecycle slice `95 passed, 399 deselected`;
  `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.

## [2026-05-24 12:53] codex | audit-fix | DSV4 route runner can reuse existing server

- Added `--base-url` and `--cases` to
  `tests/cross_matrix/run_dsv4_route_mode_code_exactness.py`, so future live
  checks can reuse an already-loaded DSV4 server and run only the known failing
  rows instead of launching a second model process or using one-off scripts.
- Refreshed dry-run artifact:
  `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-dryrun-existing-server-twofail-20260524.json`.
- Attempted to proceed to the narrow live two-case probe, but health flipped to
  `num_running=1` before the request; no live request was sent.
- Verification: route exactness unit file `9 passed`; combined route/stats
  smoke `11 passed`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
## [2026-05-24 12:59] codex | recovery | Python lane re-synced after Swift-detour audit

- Re-read `/Users/eric/vmlx` routing guard and canonical
  `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx/AGENTS.md`: active app/runtime work is Python-only;
  Swift/handoff notes from the wrapper repo are invalid for current work.
- Active working tree remains
  `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`.
- Rechecked current live/process state: no listener on `127.0.0.1:8886`, no
  reusable DSV4 server available, RAM currently clear.
- Re-read newest DSV4 route artifact:
  `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-source-after-completion-trim-budget-liveapi-20260524-1248.json`.
  It remains `status=fail`: 9/10 rows exact; only `chat_max` still corrupts
  identifiers (`PersPerspectiveCamera`, `BBoxGeometry`, `MMeshBasicMaterial`).
- Objective digest still keeps
  `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared` open.
- No fresh heavy model load launched in this recovery pass; coordination note
  sent in `.agents/MAIL.md`.

## [2026-05-24 13:04] codex | live-audit | DSV4 chat_max prompt-trigger isolated

- Reused existing loaded DSV4 server on `8886`; no new heavy process and no
  Swift work.
- Captured prompt-trigger artifact:
  `build/current-dsv4-chatmax-prompt-trigger-hypothesis-live-20260524-1258.json`.
- Captured standard two-row artifact:
  `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-existing-server-twofail-post-trigger-20260524.json`.
- Result: completion route is exact; only `chat_max` remains corrupted.
- Finding: canonical exact-code wording passes, but natural wording variants
  around `Copy`, `no markdown`, `Preserve identifier spelling`, and
  `No explanation` fail under the same effective `thinking_open` DSV4 policy.
- Decision: do not use hidden prompt rewriting or identifier substitution as a
  release fix. Keep DSV4 long-output/code quality open.

## [2026-05-24 13:08] codex | audit-refresh | settings/defaults proof board narrowed

- Refreshed stale no-heavy artifacts for max output/context, generation
  defaults, API/cache, Native MTP, and model-artifact format after current
  server/scheduler edits.
- Objective digest artifact:
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260524-post-open-row-refresh.json`.
- Result: all no-heavy/settings/defaults/parser/artifact/cache rows are now
  `PASS`; the only remaining open requirement is
  `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`.
- No live generations were sent during this refresh; `8886` stayed idle.

## [2026-05-24 13:16] codex | live-audit | DSV4 chat_max budget/stop/route ruled out

- Captured live artifact:
  `build/current-dsv4-chatmax-budget-stop-rail-live-20260524-1309.json`.
- Refreshed objective digest:
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260524-post-chatmax-budget-stop-rail.json`.
- Same `chat_max` wording fails across chat, responses, and completions with
  identical 445-token corrupted output.
- Larger output budget, role stops, thinking-on, and low-effort diagnostics do
  not fix the corruption.
- Objective digest now surfaces this as
  `current_chatmax_budget_stop_rail_probe`.
- DSV4 long-output/code quality remains the only open proof-board row.

## [2026-05-24 13:52] codex | no-heavy | DSV4 prefill execution variant logits wired into proof board

- No live generation, no server launch, no Swift.
- Added proof-board tracking for
  `build/current-dsv4-jang-prefill-execution-variant-logits-20260524.json`.
- Red tests first:
  - objective digest failed on missing
    `current_prefill_execution_variant_logits`;
  - release manifest failed on missing prefill-execution artifact.
- Cleaned duplicate `_dsv4_template_parity_diagnostic_detail` definition while
  touching the summarizer; retained helper remains covered by focused tests.
- Refreshed:
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260521.json`,
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260524-codex-recheck.json`,
  and `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260521.json`.
- Current digest evidence:
  - target context `after generated prefix THREE.P`;
  - six execution variants;
  - all variants keep the same top-token ordering;
  - all variants select correct `ers`;
  - whole-token `Pers` is never top.
- Current interpretation: stream/warmup/clear execution state is not the cause
  of the isolated `THREE.P -> ers` prefix behavior. The broader DSV4 exact-code
  row remains open because full prompt context still flips other identifier
  logits.
- Verification:
  focused tests `6 passed`; py_compile pass; `git diff --check` pass.
- Health after refresh: `8886` idle (`num_running=0`, `num_waiting=0`).

## [2026-05-24 13:48] codex | no-heavy | DSV4 template parity wired into proof board

- No live generation, no server launch, no Swift.
- Added proof-board tracking for
  `build/current-dsv4-template-parity-diagnostic-20260524-1343.json`.
- Red tests first:
  - objective digest test failed because
    `current_template_parity_diagnostic` was missing;
  - release manifest test failed because the DSV4 live row did not list the
    template-parity artifact.
- Refreshed:
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260521.json`,
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260524-codex-recheck.json`,
  and `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260521.json`.
- Current digest evidence:
  - sidecar encoder equals bundle `chat_template.jinja` for all checked cases;
  - mismatch count is zero;
  - normal colon/period prompts have equal token counts;
  - boundary token is `.Ċ` for period and `:Ċ` for colon.
- Current interpretation: the colon/period exact-code split is not caused by a
  vMLX custom renderer vs bundle-template mismatch.
- Verification:
  focused tests `6 passed`; py_compile pass; `git diff --check` pass.
- Health after refresh: `8886` idle (`num_running=0`, `num_waiting=0`).

## [2026-05-24 13:44] codex | live-audit | DSV4 hidden-reasoning controls fail; Ling manifest wording aligned

- Active repo only; no Swift, no package/release work.
- Claimed `8886` in `.agents/MAIL.md` before live requests and only sent
  requests while health was idle.
- The initial four-request diagnostic exceeded the tool session before writing
  output, so I switched to one request per command and wrote artifacts
  immediately.
- New live artifacts:
  - `build/current-dsv4-hidden-reasoning-control-period_no_reasoning_draft-live-20260524.json`
    -> fail, length stop at 220 tokens, no code markers in hidden reasoning,
    but visible output still corrupts `WebWebGLRenderer`;
  - `build/current-dsv4-hidden-reasoning-control-period_verify_identifiers-live-20260524.json`
    -> fail, length stop at 220 tokens, visible output missing all required
    Three.js identifiers while hidden reasoning contains corrupted code markers.
- Refreshed objective digest now surfaces the existing integrated artifact
  `build/current-dsv4-hidden-reasoning-control-live-20260524-1335.json`:
  period controls still fail, no-draft can remove hidden corruption markers
  without fixing visible exactness, and cache-hit tokens remain zero.
- No runtime behavior changed. Current implication: hidden reasoning draft
  contamination is real evidence, but simple reasoning steering/suppression is
  not sufficient as a production fix.
- Also corrected a release-manifest reporting inconsistency for Ling/Bailing:
  the objective row is now pass from named zero-CJK clearance artifacts, while
  older failing artifacts remain tracked as regression evidence.
- Refreshed:
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260521.json`,
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260524-codex-recheck.json`,
  and `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260521.json`.
- Verification:
  focused tests `6 passed`; py_compile pass; `git diff --check` pass.
- Health after work: `8886` idle (`num_running=0`, `num_waiting=0`).

## [2026-05-24 13:27] codex | live-audit | DSV4 prompt punctuation flips visible logits

- Captured live prompt-boundary and logprob artifacts:
  `build/current-dsv4-prompt-boundary-bisection-live-20260524-1317.json`,
  `build/current-dsv4-colon-vs-period-visible-logprob-trace-live-20260524-1322.json`,
  and `build/current-dsv4-scene-token-rank-contrast-live-20260524-1324.json`.
- Passing boundary: `no markdown fences:` and `no markdown fences`.
- Failing boundary: `no markdown fences.`, `no markdown.`, `No explanation`,
  and `Please` variants.
- At visible `THREE.Scene`, colon prompt ranks `ene` first; period prompt ranks
  wrong `();\n` first and `ene` second.
- Hidden reasoning includes a corrupted fenced code draft before visible output;
  colon recovers in visible output, period follows the corrupted draft.
- Current root cause is below API/settings and output finalization: prompt
  context changes DSV4 logits on the thinking rail.

## [2026-05-24 13:58] codex | proof-board | Scene token rank contrast wired into objective evidence

- No live generation, no server launch, no Swift.
- Integrated
  `build/current-dsv4-scene-token-rank-contrast-live-20260524-1324.json`
  into objective digest and release manifest evidence.
- Red tests first:
  - objective digest test failed until
    `current_scene_token_rank_contrast` was surfaced;
  - release manifest test failed until the scene-rank artifact was listed.
- Corrected reporting detail:
  - artifact `scene_token_index=123` is the `.Sc` token;
  - decisive rank contrast is the next token, index `124`.
- Refreshed:
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260521.json`,
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260524-codex-recheck.json`,
  and `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260521.json`.
- Current proof board still has exactly one open requirement:
  `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`.
- Verification:
  - focused objective/release/current-regression tests: `6 passed`;
  - py_compile for touched proof/reporting files: pass;
  - `git diff --check`: pass;
  - health after refresh: `8886` idle (`num_running=0`, `num_waiting=0`).

## [2026-05-24 13:02] codex | cleanup | Wrapper stale implementation notes removed recursively

- Recursively searched `/Users/eric/vmlx` for `swift|handoff` after the earlier
  maxdepth-only cleanup missed root/docs/notes/sweep artifacts.
- Deleted remaining stale wrapper implementation/audit/triage/spec/status files
  containing those references.
- Replaced `/Users/eric/vmlx/README.md` with a routing-only guard and rewrote
  `/Users/eric/vmlx/AGENTS.md` to point only at the active Python repo without
  preserving old implementation-path wording.
- Verified:
  `rg --files /Users/eric/vmlx | rg -i 'swift|handoff'` -> no output;
  recursive content `rg -n -i 'swift|handoff' /Users/eric/vmlx ...` -> no
  output outside ignored cache/binary areas.

## [2026-05-24 13:03] codex | audit-fix | Objective digest now tracks latest DSV4 route artifact

- Updated `summarize_objective_proof.py` so DSV4 prompt/route exactness prefers
  the latest source-current route artifact:
  `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-source-after-completion-trim-budget-liveapi-20260524-1248.json`.
- Added `failed_cases` to the DSV4 route detail so status no longer depends on
  stale "thinking-closed" terminology after server policy forces DSV4 onto the
  quality rail.
- Added regression test proving a stale passing route artifact is ignored when
  the current source route artifact is red.
- Verification:
  focused objective proof tests `3 passed`;
  `py_compile` passed;
  `git diff --check` passed.
- Refreshed `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260524-codex-recheck.json`.
  It now reports DSV4 route artifact
  `current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-source-after-completion-trim-budget-liveapi-20260524-1248.json`,
  probe status `fail`, failed cases `["chat_max"]`.

## [2026-05-24 13:50] codex | no-heavy | Colon-vs-period logprob traces wired into proof board

- No live generation sent; no server launched; no Swift touched.
- Integrated:
  - `build/current-dsv4-colon-vs-period-logprob-trace-live-20260524-1320.json`;
  - `build/current-dsv4-colon-vs-period-visible-logprob-trace-live-20260524-1322.json`.
- Key evidence now in objective digest:
  - colon pass and period fail both use `prompt_tokens=90`,
    `completion_tokens=195`, and `logprob_entry_count=195`;
  - cache hit tokens are zero before/after in both trace artifacts;
  - colon visible output is exact while period visible output corrupts
    identifiers;
  - period visible divergence starts at char index `26`, token index `124`;
  - colon hidden thinking includes corruption markers even though its visible
    post-`</think>` answer is clean.
- Refreshed:
  - `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260521.json`;
  - `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260524-codex-recheck.json`;
  - `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260521.json`.
- Current proof board still has exactly one open row:
  `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`.
- Verification:
  focused objective/release/current-regression tests -> `6 passed`;
  py_compile for touched proof/reporting files -> pass;
  `git diff --check` -> pass.
- `8886` health after refresh: idle (`num_running=0`, `num_waiting=0`).

## [2026-05-24 13:42] codex | no-heavy | DSV4 prompt-boundary bisection wired into proof board

- No live generation sent; no server launched; no Swift touched.
- Read `build/current-dsv4-prompt-boundary-bisection-live-20260524-1317.json`.
- Key finding from artifact:
  - `canonical_return_fences_colon` passes;
  - `return_fences_no_punct` passes;
  - `return_fences_period` fails with identifier corruption under the same
    effective `thinking_open` rail;
  - `return_markdown_colon_no_fences`, `return_code_only_colon`, and
    `please_return_fences_colon` length-fail;
  - `return_fences_colon_no_explanation` stops after blank visible content.
- Added objective digest detail:
  `current_prompt_boundary_bisection_probe`.
- Added release manifest tracking for
  `build/current-dsv4-prompt-boundary-bisection-live-20260524-1317.json`.
- Refreshed:
  - `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260521.json`;
  - `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260524-codex-recheck.json`;
  - `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260521.json`.
- Current proof board still has exactly one open row:
  `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`.
- Verification:
  focused objective/release/current-regression tests -> `7 passed`;
  py_compile for touched proof/reporting files -> pass;
  `git diff --check` -> pass.
- `8886` health after refresh: idle (`num_running=0`, `num_waiting=0`).

## [2026-05-24 13:34] codex | no-heavy | Release manifest DSV4 row now tracks current open evidence

- No live generation sent; no server launched; no Swift touched.
- Found stale release-reporting gap: `dsv4-long-output-quality-live` listed
  early DSV4 artifacts but not the current chatmax route/prompt-trigger and
  budget/stop/rail failure artifacts.
- TDD red:
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_release_regression_manifest.py::test_release_regression_manifest_tracks_fresh_dsv4_live_failure_artifact`
  failed because the latest source/live route artifact was missing from the
  manifest row.
- Updated `tests/cross_matrix/release_regression_manifest.py` so the DSV4 live
  row lists:
  - `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-source-after-completion-trim-budget-liveapi-20260524-1248.json`;
  - `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-existing-server-chatmax-20260524.json`;
  - `build/current-dsv4-chatmax-prompt-trigger-hypothesis-live-20260524-1258.json`;
  - `build/current-dsv4-chatmax-budget-stop-rail-live-20260524-1309.json`.
- Refreshed `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260521.json`; its
  DSV4 row now includes those artifacts and notes that chat_max remains open
  and budget/stops/thinking/routes are not sufficient fixes.
- Verification:
  focused release manifest tests -> `4 passed`;
  py_compile for manifest code/tests -> pass;
  `git diff --check` -> pass.

## [2026-05-24 13:26] codex | no-heavy | Canonical objective audit refreshed for release consumers

- No live generation sent; no server launched; no Swift touched.
- Found proof-plumbing risk: the umbrella/current release plumbing reads
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260521.json`, not only the
  `codex-recheck` audit file.
- Refreshed `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260521.json`.
- It now includes the DSV4 budget/stop/rail probe detail and still has exactly
  one open row:
  `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`.
- Focused verification:
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_current_regression_suite.py::test_current_regression_suite_allows_only_declared_known_blockers tests/test_current_regression_suite.py::test_current_regression_suite_refreshes_release_regression_manifest tests/test_release_regression_manifest.py::test_release_regression_manifest_tracks_current_post_budget_edge_proof_sweep tests/test_release_regression_manifest.py::test_release_regression_manifest_validates_current_proof_sweep_artifacts tests/test_release_regression_manifest.py::test_release_regression_manifest_runner_embeds_current_proof_validation tests/test_release_regression_manifest.py::test_release_regression_manifest_runner_can_require_current_proof_sweep`
  -> `6 passed`.
- `git diff --check`: pass.

## [2026-05-24 13:23] codex | no-heavy | DSV4 budget/stop/rail matrix added to current proof board

- No live generation sent; no server launched; no Swift touched.
- Read `build/current-dsv4-chatmax-budget-stop-rail-live-20260524-1309.json`.
- Confirmed artifact `status=fail`, 7/7 variants fail:
  `chatmax_512_baseline`, `chatmax_1024_budget`,
  `chatmax_1024_stop_roles`, `chatmax_1024_thinking_on`,
  `chatmax_1024_effort_low`, `responses_chatmax_1024`,
  `completion_chatmax_512`.
- The digest detail now shows all failed cases stopped at the same
  `completion_tokens=445` and still corrupt identifiers under
  `thinking_open`.
- Refreshed `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260524-codex-recheck.json`.
  It still has exactly one open row:
  `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`.
- Verification:
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_objective_proof_digest.py::test_objective_proof_digest_surfaces_dsv4_chatmax_budget_stop_rail_probe tests/test_objective_proof_digest.py::test_objective_proof_digest_surfaces_dsv4_chatmax_prompt_trigger_probe`
  -> `2 passed`;
  `py_compile` for objective summarizer/tests -> pass;
  `git diff --check` -> pass.
- Current conclusion: do not spend live time retesting max-token budget, role
  stops, requested thinking-on, effort-low, Responses surface, or completion
  route as standalone fixes; this artifact already rules them out as sufficient.

## [2026-05-24 13:16] codex | no-heavy | DSV4 prompt-trigger evidence wired into objective digest

- No live generation sent; no server launched; no Swift touched.
- Added objective-digest coverage for
  `build/current-dsv4-chatmax-prompt-trigger-hypothesis-live-20260524-1258.json`.
- Fixed stale synthetic clear-case test fixture so a DSV4 quality pass requires
  the new chatmax prompt-trigger evidence file to exist.
- Verification:
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_objective_proof_digest.py::test_objective_proof_digest_surfaces_dsv4_chatmax_prompt_trigger_probe tests/test_objective_proof_digest.py::test_objective_proof_digest_prefers_latest_source_route_exactness_probe tests/test_objective_proof_digest.py::test_objective_proof_digest_surfaces_dsv4_prompt_rail_exactness_probe tests/test_objective_proof_digest.py::test_objective_proof_digest_accepts_dsv4_quality_clearance_artifact`
  -> `4 passed`.
- `py_compile` for `tests/cross_matrix/summarize_objective_proof.py` and
  `tests/test_objective_proof_digest.py`: pass.
- `git diff --check`: pass.
- Refreshed `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260524-codex-recheck.json`.
  It now has exactly one open row:
  `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`.
- Prompt-trigger digest detail:
  - artifact status `fail`;
  - canonical exact case `canonical_return_fences`;
  - failed cases `chatmax_original`, `copy_no_preserve`,
    `copy_preserve_fences`, `return_no_fences_word`,
    `return_preserve_no_expl_fences`, `copy_exactly_fences`;
  - effective policy reason remains `dsv4_direct_rail_identifier_unsafe`.
- Existing `8886` health after refresh showed `num_running=1`,
  `num_waiting=0`; I did not claim or use it.

## [2026-05-24 13:04] codex | live-probe | Existing-server DSV4 chat_max reconfirmed

- Reused already-loaded `8886` only after `.agents/MAIL.md` claim and idle
  health check.
- Ran:
  `.venv/bin/python tests/cross_matrix/run_dsv4_route_mode_code_exactness.py --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8886 --cases chat_max --model /Users/eric/models/JANGQ/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-JANGTQ-K --out build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-existing-server-chatmax-20260524.json`
- Result `status=fail`, as expected for current DSV4 quality state.
- `chat_max`: `finish=stop`, no markdown fence, but corrupts
  `THREE.PerspectiveCamera`, `THREE.BoxGeometry`, `THREE.MeshBasicMaterial`
  into `PersPerspectiveCamera`, `BBoxGeometry`, `MMeshBasicMaterial`.
- Prompt diagnostics: requested `thinking_closed`, server-effective
  `thinking_open`, policy reason `dsv4_direct_rail_identifier_unsafe`.
- `/health` after request is idle (`num_running=0`, `num_waiting=0`).
- No new model server launched; no release/package work.

## [2026-05-24 13:08] codex | no-heavy | Stale max-output and API/cache proof rows refreshed

- Refreshed max-output/context contract after DSV4 server edits:
  `build/current-max-output-context-contract-20260524-after-chatmax-dsv4-server-edits.json`.
  Status `pass`; engine `25 passed`; panel `54 passed`; no missing markers.
- Refreshed API/cache contract after DSV4 server and scheduler diagnostics edits:
  `build/current-api-cache-contract-proof-20260524-after-chatmax-dsv4-scheduler-edits.json`.
  Status `pass`; API route `26 passed`; scheduler cache `7 passed`;
  TQ/MLLM cache `32 passed`; DSV4 DSML/tool `21 passed`; no missing markers.
- Updated `summarize_objective_proof.py` and
  `tests/test_objective_proof_digest.py` to point at the current proof
  artifacts and preserve missing/stale-artifact regression coverage.
- Focused digest tests passed:
  - max-output/context artifact required+accepted tests;
  - API/cache artifact missing/accepted/stale-hash tests;
  - latest DSV4 route exactness preference test.
- Refreshed `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260524-codex-recheck.json`.
  Current objective digest has exactly one open row:
  `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`.
- `8886` remains loaded and idle; no further live request sent in this slice.

## [2026-05-24 13:31] codex | analysis | DSV4 exact-code root-cause boundary tightened

- No live generation, no server launch, no Swift.
- Inspected saved DSV4 logit/logprob artifacts instead of rerunning the heavy
  direct-vector harness while `8886` is loaded.
- Refreshed:
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260524-deep-root-cause-recheck.json`.
- Current proof digest still has exactly one open requirement:
  `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`.
- Evidence now points below API/UI/finalizer/cache settings:
  - DSV4 model logits can prefer malformed identifier continuations in some
    prompt/prefix contexts (`IVE` over `REE`, whole-token `Pers` after `.P`,
    `();\n` over `ene` after `.Sc`);
  - tokenizer roundtrip is clean, so the corrupt strings are valid generated
    token choices, not decode corruption;
  - colon/no-punct prompt boundaries can recover exact visible output, while a
    period after the same instruction flips the rank ordering under the same
    effective rail and prompt/completion token counts;
  - hidden reasoning drafts are corrupted in both colon and period traces, but
    only the period trace propagates the corruption into visible output.
- Current non-fix boundary: do not present prompt rewrite, identifier
  substitution, forced token patching, or visible-output postprocessing as a
  production fix.
- Tokenizer-only boundary check: the passing colon/no-punctuation and failing
  period prompts differ by a single boundary token before `const` (`:Ċ`, `Ċ`,
  `.Ċ`). This supports a real prompt-token conditioning failure, not a
# 2026-05-24 14:21 PDT - explicit-off DSV4 exact-code live subset

- Claimed non-overlapping live lane on port `8891`, avoiding dead/reserved
  `8886`.
- Added red/green coverage for launch-mode `--cases`; patched route exactness
  runner so live launch honors case filters and records selected cases.
- Ran DSV4 source live subset:
  `chat_off,responses_off,legacy_completion_raw`.
- Artifact:
  `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-source-explicit-off-subset-20260524-1418.json`.
- Result: `status=fail`; all three thinking-closed cases corrupt visible
  identifiers/code under `enable_thinking=False`.
- Updated objective digest to prefer the new explicit-off artifact; updated
  release manifest proof text/artifact list.
- Current objective proof open rows:
  - `DSV4 default-cache multi-tool agent loop is proven`;
  - `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`.
- Verification:
  - focused route/objective/release/current-suite tests `15 passed`;
  - proof/reporting `py_compile` pass;
  - `git diff --check` pass;
  - no `8891` server process remains.

# 2026-05-24 14:16 PDT - DSV4 route diagnostic precedence fix

- No live generation; no server/process touched.
- Found route-exactness proof diagnostic drift: helper used
  `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking` before top-level `enable_thinking`,
  unlike server precedence.
- Added red/green test and patched helper to mirror server precedence.
- Refreshed DSV4 route dry-run artifacts.
- Refreshed objective/release artifacts again; only open row remains:
  `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`.
- Verification:
  - red test failed first with `assert True is False`;
  - focused route/objective/current-suite tests `13 passed`;
  - active reasoning-policy focused source tests `9 passed, 47 deselected`;
  - proof/reporting `py_compile` pass;
  - `git diff --check` pass.

# 2026-05-24 14:12 PDT - no-live proof-board stale-hash refresh

- Did not use live generation; `8886` remains reserved by the 14:06
  reasoning-policy lane.
- Refreshed max-output/context, API/cache, model-artifact-format,
  generation-defaults, and native-MTP no-heavy contract artifacts.
- Refreshed objective proof and release manifest artifacts.
- Current objective proof now has exactly one open row:
  `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`.
- Release manifest current proof sweep is `pass`, rows `20`.
- Verification:
  - focused objective/release/current-suite tests `8 passed`;
  - proof/reporting `py_compile` pass;
  - `git diff --check` pass.

# 2026-05-24 14:09 PDT - routing incident containment

- No live generation, no server launch, no Swift.
- Deleted deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx/.agents` because it still contained
  Swift/JangPress mailbox, status, rules, and handoff state that could misroute
  post-compaction work.
- Removed deprecated wrapper `build/*swift*` and `build/*jangpress*` artifacts.
- Verified no `/Users/eric/vmlx/swift` directory and no `*swift*`,
  `*handoff*`, or `*JangPress*` paths within four levels of the deprecated
  wrapper.
- Current Python lane remains in
  `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; DSV4 exact-code quality is
  not release-cleared.

  whitespace-normalization artifact.

## [2026-05-24 14:29] codex | regression | strengthened DSV4 default-cache tool-loop proof

- Tightened the objective digest contract for
  `build/current-dsv4-default-cache-tool-loop/result.json` so shallow
  two-tool artifacts no longer satisfy the DSV4 default-cache multi-tool row.
- Required proof now covers the real long chain Eric requested:
  DSML tool parser, DeepSeek R1 reasoning parser, native DSV4
  prefix/paged/L2 cache, cached tokens/cache detail, exact HTML write,
  exact Three.js `scene.js` write, and final `DONE`.
- Updated current-suite and packaged-integrity expected-open blockers to
  include `DSV4 default-cache multi-tool agent loop is proven` alongside
  DSV4 exact-code quality.
- Refreshed artifacts:
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260524-long-tool-chain-contract.json`,
  `build/current-regression-suite-20260524-long-tool-chain-contract.json`,
  `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-20260524-long-tool-chain-contract.json`.
- Verification:
  focused contract tests `36 passed, 50 deselected`;
  broader focused regression `189 passed, 37 deselected`;
  packaged integrity `status=pass`, `failed=[]`;
  umbrella no-heavy suite `status=pass`, `failed_steps=[]`;
  proof/reporting `py_compile` pass; `git diff --check` pass.
- Boundary: no release clearance. Open DSV4 rows remain exact-code quality and
  default-cache long-chain tool-loop proof. No Swift touched.

## [2026-05-24 13:47] codex | no-heavy | DSV4 template parity evidence added to proof/manifest

- Integrated:
  `build/current-dsv4-template-parity-diagnostic-20260524-1343.json`.
- Refreshed:
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260524-template-parity.json`;
  `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260524-template-parity.json`.
- Red/green tests:
  - digest failed first on missing `current_template_parity_diagnostic`;
  - release manifest failed first on missing template-parity artifact;
  - green focused run:
    `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_objective_proof_digest.py -k 'template_parity or hidden_reasoning_control or colon_period_logprob_trace or scene_token_rank_contrast or prompt_boundary' tests/test_release_regression_manifest.py::test_release_regression_manifest_tracks_fresh_dsv4_live_failure_artifact`
    -> `5 passed, 43 deselected`.
- Current objective proof remains one open row:
  `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`.

## [2026-05-24 13:43] codex | coordination | canonical checkout drift noted

- Checked `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx`: `main` at `754f817b`, large dirty tree.
- This guard worktree: `codex/pr-intake-manifest` at `465e7141`, with latest
  2026-05-24 objective proof artifacts and DSV4 hidden-reasoning control
  evidence.
- Decision for this slice: keep audit/proof work in the guard worktree and do
  not copy source changes into the dirty canonical checkout without an explicit
  sync/reconciliation step.
- No-live-generation DSV4 prompt-template/config comparison artifact:
  `build/current-dsv4-template-parity-diagnostic-20260524-1343.json`.
- Result: vMLX sidecar encoder exactly matches the bundle
  `chat_template.jinja` for colon/period/system-no-draft exact-code prompts
  across thinking-closed, thinking-open, and max-thinking variants.
- Colon/period normal rails both have 90 prompt tokens; the relevant boundary
  token is `.Ċ` vs `:Ċ`.
- Current interpretation: not a custom encoder vs bundle Jinja mismatch.

## [2026-05-24 13:39] codex | live-probe | DSV4 hidden-reasoning control still fails visible identifiers

- Used existing loaded `8886` only after health showed idle.
- No source behavior change, no package/release work, no Swift.
- New artifact:
  `build/current-dsv4-hidden-reasoning-control-live-20260524-1335.json`.
- Refreshed proof board:
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260524-hidden-reasoning-control.json`.
- Results:
  - colon control exact;
  - period control failed;
  - period + "do not draft code in hidden reasoning" failed even though hidden
    corruption was removed for that case;
  - period + internal identifier verification failed and used more tokens.
- Current conclusion: hidden reasoning draft contamination is real but not the
  sole root cause. DSV4 has a base prompt-conditioned visible identifier/logit
  weakness under exact-code period context.
- Verification:
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_objective_proof_digest.py -k 'hidden_reasoning_control or colon_period_logprob_trace or scene_token_rank_contrast or prompt_boundary'`
  -> `4 passed, 42 deselected`;
  `git diff --check` -> pass.
- Cleanup: the heredoc diagnostic client process (`.venv/bin/python -`, PID
  `17152`) kept its HTTP socket open after writing the artifact and made health
  briefly report `num_running=1`. Terminated that client only; server PID
  `7567` stayed up and returned to `num_running=0`, `num_waiting=0`.
# 2026-05-24 14:02 PDT - DSV4 prompt-variant logit probe proof-board integration

- No live generation, no server launch, no Swift.
- Added objective digest detail for
  `build/current-dsv4-jang-prompt-variant-logit-probe-20260524.json`.
- Added release manifest artifact/proves text for the same prompt-variant
  logit probe.
- Refreshed:
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260521.json`,
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260524-prompt-variant-logit.json`,
  `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260521.json`, and
  `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260524-prompt-variant-logit.json`.
- Current objective digest still has exactly one open row:
  `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`.
- Verification:
  focused objective/release/current-regression tests `7 passed`;
  py_compile pass; `git diff --check` pass; `8886` idle.
- Boundary: prompt wording/logit sensitivity is first-class evidence, not a
  production fix or release clearance.

## [2026-05-24 14:50] codex | live-probe | DSV4 long-chain parser repairs, exact-code blocker isolated
## [2026-05-24 16:27] codex | proof-board | one-open DSV4 split restored after stale strict runner

- Waited for a stale runner writing
  `build/current-regression-suite-20260524-strict-dsv4-two-open.json` to exit
  before touching shared proof files.
- Restored the agreed one-open split:
  `DSV4 default-cache multi-tool agent loop is proven` passes on
  tool/cache/parser mechanics; `code_file_written_exact=false` remains in row
  details; exact code/body fidelity is tracked only by
  `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`.
- Focused verification:
  objective/current-suite/packaged split tests -> `5 passed`.
- Refreshed:
  - `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260524-default-cache-live-review.json`
    -> only DSV4 exact-code quality open;
  - `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-20260524-default-cache-live-review.json`
    -> `status=pass`, `failed=[]`;
  - `build/current-regression-suite-20260524-default-cache-tool-loop-cleared.json`
    -> `status=pass`, `failed_steps=[]`, one open row;
  - `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260524-codex-audit.json`
    -> `current_proof_sweep=pass`.
- No DSV4 live model was launched; exact-code release row remains blocked by
  live validation under sufficient RAM.

## [2026-05-24 16:19] codex | dsv4-live-gate | exact-code row RAM-gated, current rail diagnostics refreshed

- No Swift/wrapper work. Stayed in
  `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`.
- Reconfirmed release proof board after the default-cache mechanics split:
  `build/current-regression-suite-20260524-default-cache-tool-loop-cleared.json`
  is `status=pass`, `failed_steps=[]`, with only
  `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared` open.
- Local DSV4 exact-code route probe was RAM-gated, not forced:
  `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-memory-preflight-20260524.json`
  -> `status=skipped`, `reason=insufficient_free_memory`,
  `required_available_gb=120.0`, available about `72.65 GB`.
- Checked `erics-m5-max2.local` as a possible live lane. It has the DSV4 model
  path, but an existing Qwen 35B MTP server on `127.0.0.1:8012` leaves about
  `87 GB` free, so DSV4 was not started there either.
- Refreshed no-model current-source DSV4 prompt rail diagnostics:
  `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-dryrun-20260524-current-rail.json`.
  Current source keeps explicit-off requests on `thinking_closed` for chat and
  responses; completion maps to the same closed chat rail. This distinguishes
  current behavior from older artifacts that recorded
  `dsv4_direct_rail_identifier_unsafe` force-on policy.
- Focused verification passed:
  `tests/test_dsv4_route_mode_code_exactness.py` +
  `tests/test_reasoning_modes.py -k 'dsv4_code_exactness or dsv4_thinking_policy'`
  -> `20 passed, 40 deselected`.
- Remaining release blocker: live DSV4 exact-code/identifier fidelity under a
  real current-source load. Do not cut release until that row is live-proven or
  explicitly scoped out by Eric.


- No Swift work.
- Live DSV4 default-cache gate on JANGTQ-K showed native cache path working but
  exposed DSML parser lossage and exact-code body corruption.
- Fixed DSML parser handling for:
  self-closing parameter tags carrying `string=` values, typoed `invuse`
  start tags, and bogus canonical `" string="` decoded args.
- Final live artifact:
  `build/current-dsv4-default-cache-tool-loop/result.json` -> `status=review`;
  ordered tools and file writes work; all cache checks are true; only
  `code_file_written_exact=false` remains.
- Remaining concrete mismatch:
  `THREE.WebRenderer` vs `THREE.WebGLRenderer`, plus missing final semicolon.
- Bundled Python reinstalled from source; bundled verifier passed and now
  hash-gates `vmlx_engine/tool_parsers/dsml_tool_parser.py`.
- Refreshed objective and contract artifacts. Packaged integrity and current
  regression suite both pass while preserving exactly two known DSV4 open rows:
  default-cache multi-tool exact proof and long-output/code quality clearance.
- Verification: focused parser/gate/objective tests passed, all refreshed
  contract artifacts passed, `py_compile` passed, `git diff --check` passed,
  and no matching server/test/proof-runner process remains.

## [2026-05-24 15:05] codex | live-probe | DSV4 invue parser repair, prompt-boundary exactness still open

- Ran live prompt-boundary/tool-content diagnostic through Responses + DSML
  tools on DSV4 JANGTQ-K.
- First pass exposed another parser typo shape:
  `<｜DSML｜invue name="write_file">`, which canonical extraction reduced to
  bogus `" string="` args.
- Added red/green parser test and repaired the schema-gated degraded-invoke
  regex for `invue`.
- Post-fix artifact:
  `build/current-dsv4-tool-content-prompt-boundary-live-20260524-after-invue-parser.json`.
- All prompt variants now execute `write_file` and final `DONE`, but none are
  exact:
  `sentence_repr` -> `THREE.WebRenderer`;
  `colon_raw_block` -> `THREE.Mew Mesh`;
  `colon_json_fields` -> `THREE.WebWebGLRenderer`.
- Refreshed default consumed gate:
  `build/current-dsv4-default-cache-tool-loop/result.json` -> `status=review`,
  all tool/cache checks true except `code_file_written_exact=false`.
- Bundled Python reinstalled and verifier passed.
- Refreshed no-heavy API/cache, parser registry, objective, packaged
  integrity, and umbrella artifacts. Exactly two DSV4 rows remain open.
- Final checks: focused tests `31 passed, 51 deselected`, `py_compile` passed,
  `git diff --check` passed. Owned 8893 servers stopped; separate regression
  runner from parent PID `98796` left untouched.

## [2026-05-24 15:27] codex | audit | production static matrix and Qwen live-soak row corrected

- Ran no-live production-family static audit:
  `build/current-production-family-static-audit-20260524-1520.json`.
- Audit covered 32 rows; missing rows include stale `qwen36_moe_tq4` plus the
  absent DSV4/Mistral/MiniMax rows listed in the artifact summary.
- Corrected release regression manifest live-soak command to target
  `qwen36_moe_crack`, the present Qwen hybrid row, instead of absent
  `qwen36_moe_tq4`.
- Refreshed `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260521.json` and
  `build/current-regression-suite-20260524-live-soak-present-qwen.json`.
- Verification: full release-manifest tests `68 passed`; refreshed umbrella
  suite `status=pass`, `failed_steps=[]`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check`
  passed.
- Release remains blocked by exactly the same two DSV4 rows: default-cache
  multi-tool loop proof and long-output/code/file-generation clearance.

## [2026-05-24 15:45] codex | proof-model | DSV4 default-cache mechanics no longer conflated with exact-code quality

- Split objective proof logic so `DSV4 default-cache multi-tool agent loop is
  proven` gates on tool/cache/parser mechanics, not exact generated code body.
- Kept `code_file_written_exact=false` and corrupt identifier details in the
  row diagnostics so the failure remains visible.
- Updated current-regression and packaged-integrity known-open lists to one row:
  `DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality is release-cleared`.
- Refreshed artifacts:
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260521.json`,
  `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-20260524-default-cache-live-review.json`,
  and `build/current-regression-suite-20260524-default-cache-tool-loop-cleared.json`.
- Verification: `168 passed` across objective/current-suite/packaged/release
  manifest tests, `py_compile` passed, `git diff --check` passed.
- Release remains blocked by DSV4 exact-code/identifier fidelity only.
## [2026-05-24 17:19] codex | live-probe | Gemma4 visible failure traced to unsupported thinking budget

- Reproduced Gemma4 26B CRACK missing visible content with Responses thinking
  on, `max_thinking_tokens=16`, `max_tokens=128`, no prefix cache:
  `visible_chars=0`, `reasoning_chars=483`.
- Proved cache is not the root cause: no-cache reproduces the failure.
- Proved output cap / unsupported budget boundary: same route with
  `max_tokens=512` emits visible content, while thinking-off at 128 emits
  visible content with no reasoning.
- Proved not Responses-only: Chat thinking-on at 128/no-cache fails the same
  way.
- Refreshed metadata audit showing Gemma4 template mentions thinking but not
  `thinking_budget`.
- Added objective digest detail and test coverage so the board records the
  root-cause matrix instead of a vague Gemma4 open row.
- Refreshed packaged, manifest, and umbrella artifacts. Current release board
  is `status=pass` only with exactly four open rows: DSV4 default-cache tool
  loop, Gemma4 visible quality, Gemma4 mixed-SWA speed floor, and DSV4
  long-output/code quality.

## [2026-05-24 17:43] codex | proof-board | cross-family live smoke blocker wired into current board

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no Swift or
  deprecated wrapper work.
- Reviewed the ZAYA bundled text smoke artifact from the other lane:
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-zaya-text-bundled-20260524/summary.json`
  -> one `ZAYA1-8B-MXFP4` text row passed cache repeat and multi-turn recall.
- Refreshed objective digest so the existing cross-family smoke row is durable:
  `Cross-family live multi-turn smoke matrix is release-cleared` is open with
  only `zaya_text` covered; missing families are DSV4, Gemma4, Hy3,
  Ling/Bailing, MiniMax, Nemotron, Qwen3.6, and ZAYA-VL.
- Current release board now has five expected open rows:
  DSV4 default-cache tool loop, Gemma4 visible quality, Gemma4 mixed-SWA speed,
  cross-family live smoke, and DSV4 long-output/code quality.
- Refreshed artifacts:
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260521.json`,
  `build/current-regression-suite-20260524-live-smoke-open.json`,
  `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-20260524-live-smoke-open.json`,
  and `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260524-live-smoke-open.json`.
- Verification: focused proof tests `49 passed`; current suite `status=pass`
  with `failed_steps=[]`; packaged integrity `status=pass`; release manifest
  `current_proof_sweep=pass`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.

## [2026-05-24 17:48] codex | live-probe | ZAYA-VL smoke attempted, media path passes, text exactness fails

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no Swift or
  deprecated wrapper work.
- Ran bundled all-local smoke for `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ/ZAYA1-VL-8B-MXFP4`
  on port `8843` with media enabled:
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-zaya-vl-bundled-20260524/summary.json`.
- Result: `probe_failed`, failures=2.
- Passing parts: MLLM load, blue image, repeated blue image, red image changed,
  and text-after-image media isolation all passed. Server log shows media
  prompts skipped prefix-cache store because media embeddings are
  path-dependent.
- Failing parts: `text_cache_repeat_1` and `text_cache_repeat_2` ignored
  `Reply exactly: ACK` and listed the stable prefix words instead. The second
  request still hit `paged+zaya_cca` with `cached_tokens=40`, so this is not a
  cache-miss-only symptom.
- Objective digest now records ZAYA-VL as attempted but not covered under
  `Cross-family live multi-turn smoke matrix is release-cleared`.
- Release manifest now names the ZAYA-VL smoke command/artifact:
  `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260524-zaya-vl-smoke-open.json`
  -> `status=pass`, `current_proof_sweep=pass`.
- Verification: focused objective/manifest/suite/package tests `5 passed`,
  `py_compile` passed, `git diff --check` passed, and no live server/probe
  remains.

## [2026-05-24 17:52] codex | fix | all-local smoke video classifier aligned with runtime

- Investigated why ZAYA-VL dry-run claimed `supports_video=true` while live
  capabilities only exposed `modalities=[text, vision]`.
- Confirmed server policy is intentional: ZAYA1-VL tokenizer/video markers are
  not enough to advertise video because the local processor/template path is
  image-only unless native video config is present.
- Fixed `bench/all_local_model_smoke.py` to require explicit native video
  evidence: `video_config`, `video_preprocessor_config.json`, or Qwen-style
  video token metadata.
- Added regression test:
  `test_classify_model_does_not_infer_zaya_vl_video_from_vl_name_or_token`.
- Dry-run proof:
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-zaya-vl-dryrun-after-video-policy-20260524/inventory.json`
  now records `supports_video=false` for `ZAYA1-VL-8B-MXFP4`.
- Verification: `tests/test_all_local_model_smoke.py` plus focused
  objective/manifest smoke tests -> `23 passed`; `py_compile` and
  `git diff --check` passed.
## [2026-05-24 17:34] codex | live-probe | first bundled all-local smoke row promoted to objective gate

- Ran `bench/all_local_model_smoke.py` against bundled Python for
  `ZAYA1-8B-MXFP4` text-only probes.
- Artifact:
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-zaya-text-bundled-20260524/summary.json`
  -> `status=pass`, `failures=0`.
- The smoke proved visible ACK output, repeated-prefix cache telemetry
  (`cached_tokens=46`, `cache_detail=paged+zaya_cca`), and multi-turn recall of
  both `blue` and `cat` for ZAYA text.
- Added objective row
  `Cross-family live multi-turn smoke matrix is release-cleared`; it stays open
  until DSV4, Gemma4, Hy3, Ling/Bailing, MiniMax, Nemotron, Qwen3.6, ZAYA text,
  and ZAYA-VL rows all have live smoke evidence.
- Refreshed objective, packaged-integrity, release-manifest, and umbrella
  artifacts. Current board passes only with five known open rows.
## [2026-05-24 17:45] codex | live-probe | ZAYA-VL smoke wired as attempted-but-open

- Live bundled smoke for `ZAYA1-VL-8B-JANGTQ4` produced
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-zaya-vl-bundled-20260524/summary.json`
  with `status=probe_failed`.
- Image/VL requests passed, including blue/red color changes and no-media
  follow-up isolation. Video labels were absent, so this artifact is not video
  proof.
- Text cache repeat prompts both failed exact `ACK` by echoing/listing the
  stable prefix; the second repeat observed prefix-cache telemetry, which
  narrows the next root-cause lane to ZAYA-VL prompt/template/instruction
  behavior under text mode, not a simple cache miss.
- Objective digest, current suite, and release manifest now preserve this as
  attempted-but-missing coverage for `zaya_vl`.
- Verification: focused proof/release tests `176 passed`; current suite
  `status=pass failed_steps=[]`; packaged integrity `status=pass`; release
  manifest `status=pass current_proof_sweep=pass`; `py_compile` and
  `git diff --check` passed.
## [2026-05-24 17:57] codex | live-probe | ZAYA-VL JANGTQ4 added and ACK root cause narrowed

- Found provenance mismatch: the earlier ZAYA-VL live artifact covered
  `ZAYA1-VL-8B-MXFP4`, not JANGTQ4.
- Ran exact `ZAYA1-VL-8B-JANGTQ4` bundled smoke into
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-zaya-vl-jangtq4-bundled-20260524/summary.json`.
- JANGTQ4 also fails exact `ACK` on both text cache repeat probes; the second
  repeat has prefix-cache telemetry, and image/no-media probes pass.
- Added JANGTQ4 to the cross-family objective row; `zaya_vl` remains
  attempted-but-missing.
- Diagnostic artifacts under
  `build/current-zaya-vl-jangtq4-ack-diagnostic-20260524/` show minimal and
  system-forced ACK prompts fail exact plain ACK, and the observed ZAYA-VL
  prompt frame is plain `user: ... assistant:`. Next investigation should
  focus on template/processor selection versus working ZAYA text behavior.
- Verification: focused proof/release tests `176 passed`; current suite
  `status=pass failed_steps=[]`; release manifest
  `status=pass current_proof_sweep=pass`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check`
  passed.
## [2026-05-24 18:08] codex | live-probe | Nemotron smoke attempted but remains open

- Ran bundled smoke for `Nemotron-Omni-Nano-JANGTQ-CRACK`.
- Passed: exact ACK, cached repeat, recall, blue/red image.
- Failed: no-media text probe returned `Yes`.
- Follow-up diagnostic proved it returns `Yes` before any image too, so current
  evidence points to prompt/gate semantics or model behavior rather than image
  carryover.
- Video was not covered; runtime probe options disabled video.
- Wired Nemotron artifact and diagnostic into objective digest; cross-family
  row now has four artifacts, with only `zaya_text` covered.
- Verification: focused tests `177 passed`; current suite
  `status=pass failed_steps=[]`; release manifest
  `status=pass current_proof_sweep=pass`.
## [2026-05-24 18:15] codex | live-probe | Ling/Bailing crossed off cross-family smoke

- Ran bundled smoke for `Ling-2.6-flash-JANGTQ` into
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-ling-bailing-jangtq-bundled-20260524/summary.json`.
- Passed exact ACK, cache-hit repeat, and multi-turn recall with zero reasoning
  chars.
- Wired artifact into objective digest; cross-family covered families are now
  `zaya_text` and `ling_bailing`.
- Remaining cross-family missing list: DSV4, Gemma4, Hy3, MiniMax, Nemotron,
  Qwen3.6, ZAYA-VL.
- Verification: focused tests `177 passed`; current suite
  `status=pass failed_steps=[]`; release manifest
  `status=pass current_proof_sweep=pass`.
## [2026-05-24 18:22] codex | live-probe | Qwen3.6 crossed off cross-family smoke

- Ran bundled isolated smoke for `Qwen3.6-27B-MXFP4-CRACK` into
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-qwen36-mxfp4-crack-bundled-20260524/summary.json`.
- Passed exact ACK, cache-hit repeat (`cached_tokens=41`,
  `cache_detail=paged+ssm`), multi-turn recall, reasoning-on visible final
  (`FINAL=OK`) with extracted reasoning, image color changes, video color, and
  no-media-after-image/video checks.
- Wired the artifact into objective digest; cross-family covered families are
  now `ling_bailing`, `qwen36`, and `zaya_text`.
- Remaining cross-family missing/open list: DSV4, Gemma4, Hy3, MiniMax,
  Nemotron, ZAYA-VL.
- Verification: focused tests `177 passed`; refreshed objective
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260521.json`; current suite
  `build/current-regression-suite-20260524-zaya-vl-smoke-open.json`
  `status=pass failed_steps=[]` with five expected open rows; release manifest
  `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260524-codex-audit.json`
  `current_proof_sweep=pass`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
## [2026-05-24 18:57] codex | live-probe | Nemotron crossed off cross-family smoke

- Traced Nemotron text-only image-present behavior through rendered prompts:
  no media tokens were present in text-only prompts.
- Added system-scoped no-media attachment contract to
  `bench/all_local_model_smoke.py` and accepted `NONE` as a clean no-media
  answer.
- Fresh bundled smoke
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-nemotron-omni-jangtq-system-nomedia-bundled-20260524/summary.json`
  passed: ACK/cache/recall/reasoning/image/no-media all clean.
- Objective digest now covers `nemotron`; cross-family missing/open is down to
  DSV4 and Gemma4.
- Verification: focused tests `6 passed`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check`
  passed; current suite `status=pass failed_steps=[]`.

## [2026-05-24 18:45] codex | live-probe | Nemotron no-media failure narrowed

- Tightened all-local smoke no-media prompts with a red/green harness test so
  text-after-media probes use explicit negative-control wording.
- Reran bundled `Nemotron-Omni-Nano-JANGTQ-CRACK` into
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-nemotron-omni-jangtq-explicit-nomedia-bundled-20260524/summary.json`.
- Result remains open: ACK/cache/recall/reasoning/image color pass, but
  text-only no-media still returns `Yes`.
- Added prompt-variant diagnostic
  `build/current-nemotron-omni-no-media-prompt-variants-20260524/result.json`;
  before any image turn, text-only prompts still return image-present
  (`Yes`, `IMAGE`, count `1`), so this is not just image carryover.
- Objective and release manifest now preserve the new Nemotron evidence.
- Current cross-family missing/open list: DSV4, Gemma4, Nemotron.
- Verification: focused tests `5 passed`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check`
  passed.

## [2026-05-24 18:32] codex | live-probe | MiniMax and Hy3 crossed off cross-family smoke

- Fixed `bench/all_local_model_smoke.py` classification so MiniMax keeps
  reasoning probe coverage; the prior substring check saw `ling` inside
  `modeling_minimax_m2` and suppressed reasoning.
- Tightened `summarize_objective_proof.py` so thinking-capable smoke families
  require a `reasoning_on` request label before coverage is counted.
- Ran bundled MiniMax-small smoke:
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-minimax-small-jangtq-bundled-20260524/summary.json`
  -> `pass`, exact ACK, cache-hit repeat, recall, and `reasoning_on` visible
  `FINAL=OK`.
- Reran bundled Hy3 after classifier/gate fix:
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-hy3-jangtq2-bundled-20260524/summary.json`
  -> `pass`, exact ACK, cache-hit repeat, recall, and `reasoning_on` visible
  `FINAL=OK`.
- Cross-family covered families are now `hy3`, `ling_bailing`, `minimax`,
  `qwen36`, and `zaya_text`; missing/open are DSV4, Gemma4, Nemotron, and
  ZAYA-VL.
- Verification: focused tests `199 passed`; refreshed objective
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260521.json`; current suite
  `build/current-regression-suite-20260524-zaya-vl-smoke-open.json`
  `status=pass failed_steps=[]` with five expected open rows; release manifest
  `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260524-codex-audit.json`
  `current_proof_sweep=pass`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
## [2026-05-24 19:18] codex | live-probe | Gemma4 visible/cross-family crossed off

- Traced Gemma4 26B CRACK visible failure to unsupported
  `max_thinking_tokens`/`thinking_budget` control: the local Gemma4 template
  opens thinking rails but does not consume `thinking_budget`, so
  `enable_thinking=true + max_thinking_tokens=16 + max_tokens=128` can use all
  output tokens for reasoning and produce no visible text.
- Confirmed app metadata already reports `thinkingBudgetSupported=false`, so
  the panel does not surface/apply `maxThinkingTokens` for this bundle.
- Ran app-real Responses visible probe:
  `build/current-runtime-memory-stress-gemma4-26b-jang4m-responses-thinkingon-app-visible-512-nocache-20260524.json`
  -> `pass`, visible English output, identifiers preserved, no warnings.
- Ran bundled Gemma4 all-local smoke:
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-26b-crack-bundled-20260524/summary.json`
  -> `pass`, exact ACK/cache, recall, reasoning visible `FINAL=OK`,
  blue/red image checks, and no-media `NONE`.
- Objective now marks Gemma4 visible-content/language as pass and cross-family
  covers `gemma4`, `hy3`, `ling_bailing`, `minimax`, `nemotron`, `qwen36`,
  `zaya_text`, `zaya_vl`; cross-family remains open only for DSV4.
- Remaining open rows are DSV4 default-cache tool loop, Gemma4 mixed-SWA speed,
  cross-family live smoke, and DSV4 long-output/code quality.
- Verification: focused tests `201 passed`; packaged integrity
  `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-20260524-gemma4-smoke-dsv4-open.json`
  `status=pass`; current suite
  `build/current-regression-suite-20260524-gemma4-visible-crossfamily-open.json`
  `status=pass failed_steps=[]`; release manifest
  `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260524-codex-audit.json`
  `current_proof_sweep=pass`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.

## [2026-05-24 20:56] codex | proof | gateway single-model auto-switch covered

- Fixed gateway single-model mode so unload failures return
  `single_model_unload_failed` instead of silently continuing into the requested
  backend with another local model still active.
- Added panel behavior proof for unload-failure handling and Ollama `/api/chat`
  model-id auto-switch with streaming content deltas preserved.
- Promoted the route-level auto-switch marker into the API-surface contract:
  `build/current-api-surface-contract-20260524-single-model-auto-switch.json`
  passed.
- Restored DSV4 default-cache exactness invariant: `code_file_written_exact`
  is required; mechanics-only proofs keep the row open.
- Fresh current proof board:
  `build/current-regression-suite-20260524-single-model-auto-switch-dsv4-exact.json`
  passed with three open rows: DSV4 default-cache multi-tool exactness, Gemma4
  mixed-SWA speed floor, and DSV4 long-output/code quality.
- Release manifest proof sweep passed at
  `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260524-single-model-auto-switch-dsv4-exact.json`.

## [2026-05-24 19:00] codex | live-probe | Nemotron no-media crossed off

- Reproduced the historical Nemotron no-media failure and separated it from
  media carryover: the old user-only prompt returned image-present even before
  any image turn.
- Live system-negative diagnostic proved deterministic text-only negatives
  before/after image traffic:
  `build/current-nemotron-omni-no-media-system-negative-diagnostic-20260524/result.json`
  -> `NO`/`0` before image, after blue image, and after red image.
- Reran full bundled Nemotron smoke at the current proof path:
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-nemotron-omni-jangtq-system-nomedia-bundled-20260524/summary.json`
  -> `pass`, exact ACK/cache, recall, `reasoning_on` visible `FINAL=OK`,
  blue/red image checks, and no-media-after-image `NONE`.
- Updated objective proof diagnostics to preserve old failing prompt evidence
  plus the new system-negative proof; refreshed objective
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260521.json`.
- Cross-family covered families are now `hy3`, `ling_bailing`, `minimax`,
  `nemotron`, `qwen36`, `zaya_text`, and `zaya_vl`; missing/open are DSV4 and
  Gemma4.
- Updated release manifest current-suite pointer to
  `build/current-regression-suite-20260524-nemotron-smoke-open.json` to avoid
  stale ZAYA-only proof sweep.
- Verification: focused tests `201 passed`; current suite
  `build/current-regression-suite-20260524-nemotron-smoke-open.json`
  `status=pass failed_steps=[]` with five expected open rows; release manifest
  `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260524-codex-audit.json`
  `current_proof_sweep=pass`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.

## [2026-05-24 18:48] codex | live-probe | ZAYA-VL crossed off with strict ACK/cache/media proof

- Reproduced ZAYA-VL JANGTQ4 exact-ACK failure under current source and traced
  it to prompt sensitivity, not cache/media/template corruption.
- Current rendered prompt frame is `<|im_start|>user...<|im_end|>`, while the
  stale plain `user: ... assistant:` diagnostic was outdated.
- Prompt diagnostics show user-only cache-prefix exact ACK can produce
  `The output is: ACK`, but system-scoped exact-output instruction produces
  bare `ACK` and repeat `cached_tokens=54`, `cache_detail=paged+zaya_cca`.
- Updated `bench/all_local_model_smoke.py` so cache-repeat probes use the
  system-scoped exact-output instruction and reject non-bare ACK.
- Reran bundled ZAYA-VL JANGTQ4 smoke:
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-zaya-vl-jangtq4-bundled-20260524/summary.json`
  -> `pass`, bare ACK on both cache probes, cache hit on repeat, recall,
  image color checks, and no-media-after-image pass.
- Cross-family covered families are now `hy3`, `ling_bailing`, `minimax`,
  `qwen36`, `zaya_text`, and `zaya_vl`; missing/open are DSV4, Gemma4, and
  Nemotron.
- Verification: focused tests `201 passed`; refreshed objective
  `build/current-objective-proof-audit-20260521.json`; current suite
  `build/current-regression-suite-20260524-zaya-vl-smoke-open.json`
  `status=pass failed_steps=[]`; release manifest
  `build/current-release-regression-manifest-20260524-codex-audit.json`
  `current_proof_sweep=pass`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
## [2026-05-27 04:16] codex | source-integration | MiMo-V2.5/JANG_2L registry and bundled import gate

- Imported relevant `erics-m5-max2.local:~/jang` MiMo/JANG2L notes and source
  snapshot into ignored local evidence at
  `docs/internal/remote-jang-notes/2026-05-27-mimo-v2-jang2l/`.
- Added conservative `mimo_v2` Python/panel detection: KV cache, qwen3
  reasoning, thinking-capable, no unproven tool parser/auto-tools, multimodal
  metadata surfaced, MTP preserved-disabled architecture hint.
- Added JANG loader pre-resolution import of `jang_tools.mimo_v2.mlx_register`
  plus `mlx_lm.models.mimo_v2` verification.
- Added bundled-python verifier imports for the same MiMo runtime modules.
- Verification: Python MiMo registry `3 passed`; JANG loader/bundled gate
  focused audit `2 passed`; release gate import test `1 passed`; panel
  registry/settings slice `32 passed`; local JANG MiMo contract `3 skipped`
  because the MiMo source volume is not mounted; `verify-bundled` passed with
  MiMo runtime imports; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: no MiMo model load/live app proof yet, and no release clearance.

## [2026-05-30 20:34] codex | Step3.7 | text-loader gate sidecar fix, quality still blocked

- Fixed Step3.7 text JANG loader gate-sidecar handling so already-quantized
  `mlp.gate.gate` modules keep uint32 weights plus `.scales/.biases` instead
  of being overwritten with bf16 and crashing quantized matmul.
- Added `_prepare_gate_dequant_weights()` and focused regression
  `test_step37_text_loader_preserves_quantized_gate_sidecars`.
- Verification: focused Step/JANG/reasoning tests `4 passed`; `py_compile` and
  `git diff --check` clean for touched files.
- Direct text bridge no longer crashes but still emits newline/underscore junk;
  tokenized one-BOS prompt and ablations for router gate float, K/V sidecars,
  lm_head float, embedding float, and RMSNorm offset did not clear it.
- Current boundary: Step3.7 remains not release-cleared; continue below
  UI/cache/tool/parser at Step3p5 runtime or JANG_2L conversion numeric
  fidelity.
## [2026-05-30 20:54] codex | Step3.7 | VLM norm fix, real UI text/tools/cache pass

- Local MacBook only; no max2, no `/Users/eric/vmlx`, no Swift.
- Added Step3.7 text-loader normalization/remap/dense-norm invariants and
  fixed source Step3.7 VLM sanitize to apply zero-centered norm `+1` on
  dense-only language shards.
- Direct VLM language generation changed from punctuation/newline corruption to
  coherent text:
  `build/step37-current-probe-20260531/direct-vlm-language-model-after-vlm-norm-fix.json`.
- Passing real Electron dev-app text/tool/cache artifact:
  `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-step37-jang2l-text-tools-cache-after-vlm-norm-fix-20260531-proof.json`.
- Still-open media artifact:
  `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-step37-jang2l-after-vlm-norm-fix-20260531-proof.json`.
  Image semantic verification fails because Step repeatedly called `read_image`
  on prior `.txt` tool files instead of answering the attached image.
- Isolated media-only artifact also fails:
  `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-step37-jang2l-media-only-after-vlm-norm-fix-20260531-proof.json`.
  The image attachment is persisted and the engine reports one processed image,
  but the assistant says it cannot see the attachment. Remaining Step3.7 VL
  blocker is image placeholder/embedding merge or prompt serialization
  semantics, not app attachment persistence.
- Verification: focused Step/JANG pytest slice `10 passed`; `py_compile` and
  `git diff --check` clean for touched files.
- 2026-05-31 00:05 PDT: fixed Step3.7 direct VLM image semantics in Python
  source runtime. `load_jang_vlm_model()` now registers the source
  `mlx_vlm.models.step3p7` adapter before `mlx_vlm` model resolution, and
  `step3p7_mlx_vlm.Model.sanitize()` maps
  `model.vit_large_projector.{weight,bias}` to
  `vit_large_projector.proj.{weight,bias}` so the actual MLX projector receives
  checkpoint weights. Direct RGB proof now passes:
  `build/step37-current-probe-20260531/direct-vlm-rgb-color-ab-after-projector-key-fix-20260531.json`.
  Projector parity artifact:
  `build/step37-current-probe-20260531/full-downsample-projector-split-parity-after-projector-key-fix-20260531.json`.
  Focused verification: `16 passed`, `py_compile` clean, `git diff --check`
  clean. Full Electron media/tool/cache E2E refresh still pending; release not
  cleared.
- 2026-05-30 21:55 PDT: Step3.7 local Electron media-only E2E now passes after
  the app-placeholder fix. The real UI/scheduler sends image payloads separately
  from text; `Step3VLProcessor.__call__()` now inserts the required image
  placeholder when images are present and the prompt has none. Proof artifact:
  `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-step37-jang2l-media-only-after-placeholder-projector-fix-20260531-proof.json`.
  Proven surfaces include `vl_image`, `responses_api`, current Electron dev
  build, settings persistence, real loaded model, cache endpoint/native/cache-hit
  telemetry, language leak check, and parser leak check. Image turn answered
  `Red`; `sendErrors=[]`; parser leaks false; cache hit was
  `paged+mixed_swa` with 20 tokens and reconstruction/dequantization OK.
  Focused verification: `17 passed`, `py_compile` clean, `git diff --check`
  clean. Full release E2E remains open for combined tools+media, LFM/other rows,
  EPIPE/write path, broader matrix, packaged sync, and release gates.
- 2026-05-30 22:03 PDT: Step3.7 combined tools+media+cache local Electron E2E
  is now green after a concrete app tool/media policy fix. Reproduced the
  combined failure first:

## [2026-06-04] codex | live-matrix | Gemma4/LFM/Step/Ling runtime refresh

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; did not touch
  deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx` or Swift paths. MiMo remained out of scope per
  user direction.
- Fixed live-smoke false failures without weakening runtime assertions:
  - `bench/all_local_model_smoke.py` now gives LFM2 strict text/tool probes a
    512-token budget so no-thinking final-answer parsing can reach the final
    answer while still requiring bare `ACK`, recalled `blue`/`cat`, and parsed
    `record_fact({"value":"blue-cat"})` tool calls.
  - LFM2 MXFP8 uses an explicit JSON-call tool prompt; LFM2 JANG_2L/MXFP4 keep
    the natural tool prompt because live probes showed the prompt contract is
    quantization-sensitive.
  - Ling multilingual loop gate now allows prompted game technical token
    `recoil` while the unrelated-Latin rejection test remains passing.
- Fresh live artifacts:
  - `build/current-gemma4-12b-live-all-unified-runtime-fullmatrix-postfix-20260604.json`
    -> pass, 9/9 Gemma 4 12B rows across conservative, prefix+paged+L2, and
    prefix+paged+q8 storage modes for MXFP4/MXFP8/JANG_4M.
  - `build/current-gemma4-12b-media-smoke-all-unified-runtime-postfix-20260604.json`
    -> pass, red-image smoke for MXFP4/MXFP8/JANG_4M.
  - `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-step-lfm-multiturn-tools-media-postfix3-20260604/summary.json`
    -> pass, Step-3.7 JANG_2L plus LFM2.5 JANG_2L/MXFP4/MXFP8.
  - `build/current-production-family-audit-live-gemma4-ling-impact-postfix-20260604.json`
    -> pass, Gemma4 26B JANG_4M CRACK, Ling JANGTQ, Ling MXFP4 CRACK.
  - `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma31-jang4m-mtp-20260604/summary.json`
    -> pass, Gemma4 31B JANG_4M-MTP.
- Proof note:
  `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-gemma4-lfm-step-ling-live-matrix-20260604-proof.json`.
- Verification: `py_compile` for touched Python files passed; focused Ling
  predicate pytest `2 passed`; all live commands above exited 0.
- Boundary: no release/upload/git operation performed. Dedicated Gemma4
  audio/video runtime rows remain separate from the image media smoke.

## [2026-06-04] codex | Gemma4 12B audio runtime integration partial, MXFP audio still red

- SSH'd into `erics-m5-max2.local`; targeted remote note search under
  `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-eric-jang`, `/Users/eric/jang`, and
  `/Users/eric/mlx` found no Gemma4 12B text-note hits. Remote bundle metadata
  was used as authoritative evidence.
- Local and remote Gemma4 12B bundle metadata hashes match for MXFP4, MXFP8,
  and JANG_4M across `config.json`, `generation_config.json`, `jang_config.json`,
  `tokenizer_config.json`, `chat_template.jinja`, `model.safetensors.index.json`,
  and `README.md`.
- Added/fixed Gemma4 Unified audio runtime path:
  - server MLLM modalities now include audio when `audio_config`/audio token
    metadata exists;
  - server no longer advertises video for `gemma4_unified` without native
    `video_config`;
  - MLLM chat extracts `input_audio`/`audio`/`audio_url`, materializes base64
    audio to temp files, and passes `audio=` through to `mlx_vlm.generate` and
    streaming;
  - `Gemma4UnifiedProcessor.process()` exposes explicit `audio` because
    `mlx_vlm.utils.process_inputs` introspects `processor.process` before
    `__call__`.
- Dedicated audio smoke added:
  `tests/cross_matrix/run_gemma4_12b_audio_smoke.py`.
- Fresh green post-change artifacts:
  - `build/current-gemma4-12b-artifact-contract-after-audio-path-20260604.json`
    -> pass.
  - `build/current-gemma4-12b-live-all-unified-runtime-after-audio-path-20260604.json`
    -> pass, 9/9 Gemma4 12B text/tool/reasoning/cache/q8 rows.
  - `build/current-gemma4-12b-image-smoke-after-audio-path-20260604.json`
    -> pass, 3/3 image rows.
  - `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-step-lfm-after-gemma4-audio-path-20260604/summary.json`
    -> pass, Step3.7 + LFM2.5 4/4 rows.
  - `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma31-jang4m-mtp-after-audio-path-20260604/summary.json`
    -> pass.
  - `build/current-production-family-audit-live-gemma4-ling-after-audio-path-20260604.json`
    -> pass.
- Audio remains not cleared for all 12B bundles:
  `build/current-gemma4-12b-audio-smoke-all-unified-runtime-speech-wav-orderfix-20260604.json`
  -> fail overall. JANG_4M transcribed `Audio present.`; MXFP4 generated
  `The transcriptionno`; MXFP8 returned empty visible content. Direct processor
  probe showed 21 `<|audio|>` placeholders matching `input_features` shape
  `(1, 21, 640)`, and all three bundles have identical float16
  `embed_audio.embedding_projection.weight` shape `(3840, 640)`. Remaining
  blocker is MXFP4/MXFP8 audio quality after runtime reaches generation, not
  endpoint rejection or missing audio projection weights.
- Boundary: no release/upload/git operation performed. Goal remains active.

## [2026-06-04] codex | MXFP Gemma4 12B audio quality remains open after focused probes

- Focused MXFP audio prompt probes after runtime audio integration:
  - `build/current-gemma4-mxfp4-audio-prompt-probe-20260604/result.json`
    -> all defensible prompt/sampling variants fail; common outputs include
    `The transcriptionno` and cannot-hear/cannot-process refusals.
  - `build/current-gemma4-mxfp8-audio-prompt-probe-20260604/result.json`
    -> temperature-0 path empty/hidden; model-owned defaults produced
    `present present`; thinking-on reasoning heard audio but looped.
  - Parser-off probes did not clear quality:
    `build/current-gemma4-mxfp8-audio-parser-probe-20260604/result.json`
    produced `Mario presents`; MXFP4 parser-off still produced
    `The transcriptionno`.
- Strengthened `tests/cross_matrix/run_gemma4_12b_audio_smoke.py` so it fails
  negative/no-audio answers, `thought`, and `transcriptionno` instead of
  accepting any output containing the substring `audio`.
- Current authoritative audio artifact:
  `build/current-gemma4-12b-audio-smoke-all-unified-runtime-current-red-20260604.json`
  -> fail overall. JANG_4M passes (`Audio present.`); MXFP4 fails
  `audio_bad_quality_marker` + missing transcription (`The transcriptionno`);
  MXFP8 fails empty visible content + missing transcription.
- Current JANG_4M-only audio proof:
  `build/current-gemma4-12b-audio-smoke-jang4m-pass-20260604.json` -> pass.
- Root-cause boundary remains: audio runtime plumbing is active, placeholder and
  feature counts line up, and audio projection weights exist as float16 in all
  three bundles. Remaining blocker is MXFP4/MXFP8 audio quality under the current
  artifacts/runtime, not endpoint rejection or missing audio projection.
- Detailed probe note:
  `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-gemma4-12b-mxfp-audio-quality-probes-20260604.json`.

## [2026-06-04] codex | source audio passes, MXFP audio capability gated off honestly

- Ran source Gemma4 12B audio comparison on `erics-m5-max2.local` using a
  temporary in-process Gemma4 Unified runtime adapter staged under `/tmp` only.
  Artifact:
  `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx/build/current-gemma4-source-audio-direct-probe-with-runtime-20260604.json`.
  Source model `/Users/eric/models/google/gemma-4-12B-it` outputs
  `Audio is present.` for temp-0, model defaults, and thinking-on.
- Local prompt-contract probe:
  `build/current-gemma4-local-mxfp-audio-prompt-contract-probe-20260604.json`.
  Empty thought channel removes raw marker leakage but does not fix MXFP audio:
  MXFP4 stays `The transcriptionno`, MXFP8 stays `Mario presents`, JANG_4M
  stays `Audio present.`.
- Alternate MXFP8 CRACK artifacts also fail audio:
  `build/current-gemma4-alt-mxfp8-audio-probe-20260604.json`.
- Changed `vmlx_engine/server.py` so Gemma4 Unified MXFP4/MXFP8 artifacts no
  longer advertise native audio based only on `audio_config`. The gate checks
  `jang_config.weight_format/profile` and refuses MXFP audio until a repaired
  artifact is stamped/proven. JANG_4M remains audio-capable.
- Fresh verification after the gate:
  - `build/current-gemma4-12b-audio-smoke-jang4m-after-mxfp-audio-cap-gate-20260604.json`
    -> pass, JANG_4M audio.
  - `build/current-gemma4-12b-audio-smoke-all-after-mxfp-audio-cap-gate-20260604.json`
    -> fail by design for MXFP4/MXFP8 `audio_not_advertised` + 400 reject;
    JANG_4M passes.
  - `build/current-gemma4-12b-image-smoke-after-mxfp-audio-cap-gate-20260604.json`
    -> pass, image/VL still green for MXFP4/MXFP8/JANG_4M.
- New proof note:
  `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-gemma4-12b-source-vs-mxfp-audio-boundary-20260604.json`.
- Boundary: MXFP4/MXFP8 audio is not working and not advertised. Real clearance
  requires repaired/reconverted MXFP artifacts or a different verified MXFP
  runtime path. No release/upload/git operation performed.

## 2026-06-04 - Gemma4 audio gate + E2E proof refresh
- Added Gemma4 Unified modality regressions: JANG_4M advertises audio, MXFP4/MXFP8 do not advertise unproven audio, Gemma4 token-only video remains gated.
- Added `--expect-audio-gated` to `tests/cross_matrix/run_gemma4_12b_audio_smoke.py` so MXFP audio can be recorded as a passing capability contract while keeping not-advertised/400 details visible.
- Green: Gemma4 12B artifact contract, 9-row text/tool/reasoning/cache matrix, audio contract with MXFP gated + JANG_4M transcription, Gemma31/LFM/Step all-local smoke slices.
- Green: Gemma26 JANG_4M CRACK and Ling MXFP4 CRACK in targeted production-family audit.
- Red: Ling JANGTQ is unstable on `ling_multilingual_loop_trigger`; one rerun passed, repeat1 failed again with unprompted CJK/English fragments. Do not release-clear Ling JANGTQ from this run.
- Proof note: `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-e2e-gemma4-lfm-step-ling-after-mxfp-audio-cap-gate-20260604.json`.

## 2026-06-04 - Gemma4 MXFP audio transform probe + rejected MXFP8 ungate
- Added `tests/cross_matrix/run_gemma4_12b_audio_transform_probe.py` to load a Gemma4 12B row once, patch only `get_audio_features`, and test input/output audio-prefix scaling through the same MLLM chat path.
- MXFP4 remains genuinely red: direct probe outputs `The transcriptionno` / refusals across scaling variants. Audio embedding stats are normal, so this is not an exploding-prefix issue.
- MXFP8 is not safe: direct raw output sometimes contains recoverable `Audio present.` behind Gemma4 channel markers, but a temporary live server/API ungate returned `Mario presents.`. Reverted ungate.
- Current safe proof restored: `build/current-gemma4-12b-audio-smoke-all-after-mxfp8-ungate-rejected-20260604.json` passes with MXFP4/MXFP8 expected-gated and JANG_4M audio green.
- New note: `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-gemma4-12b-mxfp-audio-transform-boundary-20260604.json`.

## 2026-06-04 - Ling JANGTQ prompt-aligned gate green; MXFP audio still red
- Investigated MXFP8 direct/server divergence. Direct with one fixed WAV and fresh loads produced `Mario presents.` five out of five; this is not just server parser cleanup or top_k/top_p injection. MXFP8 audio remains gated alongside MXFP4.
- Aligned Ling multilingual audit prompt with its validator: explicitly forbids English/Chinese words except HTML and Three.js. This is not a relaxed gate; the validator already enforced this constraint.
- Verified Ling JANGTQ prompt-aligned gate with three fresh live runs: `build/current-production-family-audit-live-ling-jangtq-promptaligned-repeat{1,2,3}-20260604.json`, all pass.
- Verified combined targeted production audit: `build/current-production-family-audit-live-gemma26-ling-after-ling-prompt-alignment-20260604.json`, all rows pass for Ling JANGTQ, Ling MXFP4 CRACK, Gemma4 26B JANG_4M CRACK.
- New note: `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-ling-jangtq-prompt-alignment-and-mxfp-audio-boundary-20260604.json`.

## 2026-06-04 Gemma4 12B MXFP audio boundary + jang-tools max2 sync
- Synced max2 Gemma4 converter/runtime docs into local `/Users/eric/jang/jang-tools`:
  - `jang_tools/convert_gemma4_mxfp.py`
  - `jang_tools/convert_gemma4_jang.py`
  - `tests/test_gemma4_template_patch.py`
  - `docs/GEMMA4_12B_RUNTIME_INTEGRATION_2026_06_03.md`
- Root-cause boundary captured in `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-gemma4-12b-mxfp-audio-root-cause-and-jang-tools-sync-20260604.json`.
- Current conclusion: Gemma4 12B MXFP4/MXFP8 keep audio embedder tensors fp16 but uniformly MXFP-quantize the shared decoder. JANG_4M mixed affine passes audio; MXFP audio remains red/unproven and must stay capability-gated until reconverted/proven.
- Max2 BF16 source confirmed at `/Users/eric/models/google/gemma-4-12B-it/model.safetensors`.
- Max2 MXFP8 converter dry-run confirmed 677 source tensors -> 328 uniform MXFP8 decoder tensors + 349 fp16 passthrough tensors. This reinforces the artifact/profile boundary for MXFP audio.

## 2026-06-04 Gemma4 12B MXFP8_ATTNFP16 candidate conversion started
- Added opt-in `convert_gemma4_mxfp.py` flags for selective fp16 passthrough:
  - `--preserve-attention-fp16`
  - `--preserve-full-attention-fp16`
  - `--preserve-first-layers N`
- Local and max2 focused tests: `tests/test_gemma4_template_patch.py` passed 10/10.
- Max2 dry-run for `--bits 8 --preserve-attention-fp16`: 677 tensors -> 144 MXFP8 tensors + 533 fp16 passthrough tensors.
- Full candidate conversion running on max2: PID 60050, output `/Users/eric/models/OsaurusAI/gemma-4-12B-it-MXFP8-ATTNFP16-CANDIDATE`, log `/Users/eric/jang/logs/gemma4-12b-mxfp8-attnfp16-convert-20260604.log`.
- Candidate direct probe: `build/current-gemma4-12b-mxfp8-attnfp16-direct-audio-baseline-20260604.json` failed only due raw Gemma channel markers in direct/parserless output; semantic text was `audio present` and no-audio was `NONE` with channel markers.
- Server gate updated narrowly to allow Gemma4 Unified `MXFP8_ATTNFP16` when `jang_config.quantization.selective_passthrough.preserve_attention_fp16=true`; uniform MXFP4/MXFP8 remains gated.
- Focused server modality tests passed: 3 selected / 3 passed.
- Full API audio smoke passed for candidate: `build/current-gemma4-12b-mxfp8-attnfp16-audio-smoke-20260604.json`, content `audio present`, no-audio `NONE`.
- Candidate media smoke passed: `build/current-gemma4-12b-mxfp8-attnfp16-media-smoke-20260604.json`, image answer `Red`.
- Candidate live runtime audit passed across all requested cache/runtime modes: `build/current-gemma4-12b-mxfp8-attnfp16-live-runtime-audit-20260604.json`.
  - conservative: pass
  - prefix_paged_l2: pass
  - prefix_paged_tq_q8: pass
- Important red boundary: `MXFP8_ATTNFP16` is not release-stable. It passes standalone and candidate-first audio rows, but fails with empty parsed content after a uniform MXFP8 load in the same host session.
  - pass: `build/current-gemma4-12b-mxfp8-attnfp16-audio-smoke-repeat{1,2,3}-20260604.json`
  - pass: `build/current-gemma4-12b-audio-smoke-candidate-first-20260604.json`
  - fail: `build/current-gemma4-12b-audio-smoke-mxfp8-then-attnfp16-20260604.json`
  - fail persists after 60s: `build/current-gemma4-12b-mxfp8-attnfp16-after-mxfp8-fail-solo-wait60-20260604.json`
- Do not release or ungate `MXFP8_ATTNFP16` as stable until this ordering-dependent MXFP state issue is solved or a stronger profile passes mxfp8 -> candidate churn.

## 2026-06-04 Stronger Gemma4 MXFP8 audio-safe profile attempt
- Because `MXFP8_ATTNFP16` failed after uniform MXFP8 load, next candidate is `MXFP8_ATTNFP16_L0_24_FP16`: all attention fp16 plus first 24 decoder layers fully fp16; only later MLP tensors remain MXFP8.

## [2026-06-04] Gemma4 12B release boundary and package gate refresh

Gemma4 12B default release rows are green for the honest capability surface:

- MXFP4/MXFP8/JANG_4M artifact contract: `build/current-gemma4-12b-artifact-contract-release-boundary-20260604.json` -> pass.
- Default audio gate: `build/current-gemma4-12b-audio-smoke-release-default-gated-mxfp-jang-pass-20260604.json` -> pass. MXFP rows do not advertise audio; JANG_4M returns `Audio present.` and no-audio control returns `NONE`.
- Default VL/image: `build/current-gemma4-12b-media-smoke-release-default-mxfp-jang-20260604.json` -> pass.
- Runtime/cache: `build/current-gemma4-12b-live-runtime-release-default-cache-l2-tq-fullmodes-20260604.json` -> pass across conservative, prefix+paged+L2, and prefix+paged+TurboQuant q8 modes for MXFP4/MXFP8/JANG_4M.
- Generation defaults/API/native-MTP/VL-media contracts refreshed and pass.

Candidate truth:

- `MXFP8_ATTNFP16_L0_24_FP16` is not release-stable: `build/current-gemma4-12b-audio-smoke-mxfp8-then-attnfp16-l024-20260604.json` failed after uniform MXFP8 load with empty audio content.
- `MXFP8_ATTNFP16` is not release-stable: latest all-row VL smoke returned `Maroon` instead of exact `Red`.

Packaging truth:

- Rebuilt `panel/bundled-python` from this checkout and local `/Users/eric/jang/jang-tools`; bundled verifier now passes.
- Packaged integrity still fails `release_gate_skip_app` because objective digest/release-ready manifest still have open DSV4/real-UI rows.
- Public app issue audit still fails installed-app hash guard rows `111` and `165`; a rebuilt/installed app audit is needed before release/notarization/main push.
- No signing, notarization, release upload, commit, or push was performed.

Detailed note: `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-gemma4-12b-release-boundary-and-package-gates-20260604.json`.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex Gemma4 remote-note reconciliation and release-boundary refresh

- Re-read Gemma 4 12B notes from `erics-m5-max2.local`, including the JANG runtime spec, wiki architecture invariants, JANG project memory, conversion logs, and remote source-audio probe.
- Confirmed local Gemma4 12B contract still matches remote source-of-truth: dense `gemma4_unified`, 5:1 SWA/full attention, no native MTP, zero-shift RMSNorm, heterogeneous full/sliding KV cache, generation-config EOS/suppress tokens, and fp16 passthrough early-fusion multimodal embedders for MXFP4/MXFP8/JANG_4M.
- Updated the Gemma4 release-boundary note to reflect the fresh signed/notarized DMGs and final packaged/public-audit passes.
- Removed the accidental current-scope MiMo host-availability helper/test. MiMo remains out of the current Gemma4 release work.
- Full release remains not cleared: uniform MXFP4/MXFP8 audio is gated, experimental MXFP8 attention-fp16 candidates are not release-stable, DSV4 long-output/code quality and full real-UI cross-family matrix remain open.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex post-reconcile gate refresh

- Focused Gemma4 artifact/live-audit/release-manifest tests pass after updating the five-bundle artifact fixture and stale post-DMG assertion names: `8 passed`, then stale-pointer slice `3 passed`.
- No-heavy Gemma4 artifact contract refreshed: `build/current-gemma4-12b-artifact-contract-after-remote-note-reconcile-20260604.json` -> pass for MXFP4, MXFP8, MXFP8_ATTNFP16, MXFP8_ATTNFP16_L0_24, and JANG_4M.
- Aggregate current regression suite refreshed: `build/current-regression-suite-gemma4-release-boundary-after-remote-note-reconcile-20260604.json` -> status=pass, failed_steps=[], open requirements are only real Electron UI cross-family matrix and DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality.
- Installed-app parity and public issue audit regenerated serially after the final staged app: both pass.
- Release manifest refreshed: `build/current-release-regression-manifest-gemma4-release-boundary-after-remote-note-reconcile-20260604.json` -> prepackage_ready=true, release_ready=false, current_proof_sweep=fail only because regression_suite carries the two open release-policy requirements.
- This turn changed docs/tests/agent notes only after the already-notarized DMGs; no runtime/package source changed after the final DMG build, so no fresh notarization was required from this pass alone.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex cross-family continuation proof refresh

- LFM2.5 installed Electron UI/settings proof passed against `panel/release/sequoia-app/mac-arm64/vMLX.app` and `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/LFM2.5-8B-A1B-JANG_2L`:
  - `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-lfm25-jang2l-continuation-cache-settings-20260604-proof.json`.
  - Covered max output tokens 64, Prefix Cache, Paged KV Cache, Block Disk Cache (L2), hybrid SSM native cache status, second-turn cache-hit telemetry, L2 disk counters, settings persistence, coherent output, and parser/language leak checks.
- Static Gemma4 26B/31B production-family audit passed:
  - `build/current-production-family-audit-static-gemma4-26b-31b-20260604.json`.
  - `gemma4_31b_jang4m_mtp` is tracked as an MTP-preserved artifact boundary only; no native MTP speedup claim is allowed without live accept/reject and full-output equivalence proof.
- Step3.7 VLM runtime audit passed:
  - `build/current-step37-vlm-runtime-audit-20260604-continuation.json`.
- Step3.7 installed Electron UI/settings proof passed:
  - `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-step37-jang2l-continuation-cache-settings-20260604-proof.json`.
  - Covered max output tokens 64, Prefix Cache, Paged KV Cache, Block Disk Cache (L2), stored KV cache quantization, `mixed_swa_kv_v1` native cache status, `paged+mixed_swa` second-turn cache-hit telemetry, L2 block writes, coherent output, and parser/language leak checks.
  - Boundary remains honest: config/metadata expects Step MTP, but the local index has no `mtp.*` tensors; runtime reports `metadata_inconsistent` and native MTP inactive.
- Static DSV4 local audit still blocks release claims:
  - `build/current-production-family-audit-static-dsv4-local-20260604.json`.
  - `dsv4_tq` and `dsv4_jang_local` both expose the output-head/final-norm precision boundary and need source-vs-quant or rebuilt-artifact clearance before long-output/code/file-generation production claims.
- DSV4 real-UI memory preflight refreshed:
  - `build/current-real-ui-dsv4-memory-preflight-after-step-lfm-continuation-20260604.json` -> skipped_insufficient_memory.
  - Available memory was 70.54 GB against a 120.0 GB threshold, so live DSV4 UI proof was not launched on this host.
- Added focused regression coverage for the Gemma4 31B MTP-preserved production-family row.
- Aggregate current regression suite refreshed after the Gemma31/Step/LFM continuation:
  - `build/current-regression-suite-after-gemma31-step-lfm-continuation-20260604.json` -> status=pass, failed_steps=[].
  - Open requirements remain real Electron UI cross-family live model matrix clearance and DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality clearance.
- Release manifest refreshed:
  - `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-gemma31-step-lfm-continuation-20260604.json` -> prepackage_ready=true, release_ready=false, current_proof_sweep=fail.
  - This is the correct blocker state; do not push/promote/tag as a full release from this checkout until the two open release requirements are actually closed.
- Installed-app parity and public issue audit regenerated at the manifest-owned paths:
  - `build/current-installed-app-runtime-parity-audit-gemma4-release-boundary-after-install-20260604.json` -> pass.
  - `build/current-public-app-issue-audit-gemma4-release-boundary-after-install-20260604.json` -> pass.
  - `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-installed-public-refresh-20260604.json` -> prepackage_ready=true, release_ready=false, current_proof_sweep=fail, failed_components only `regression_suite`.
  - `CURRENT_REGRESSION_SUITE_ARTIFACT` now points at `build/current-regression-suite-after-gemma31-step-lfm-continuation-20260604.json`.
  - The current suite/manifest command now audits the staged signed Sequoia app explicitly for this parity artifact (`--app panel/release/sequoia-app/mac-arm64/vMLX.app`) rather than overwriting or relying on a stale `/Applications/vMLX.app`.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex LFM2.5 Responses/tools UI proof refresh

- Initial LFM2.5 installed UI Responses/tool proof at max_tokens=128 failed `long_tool_loop`; the model described the first tool call instead of issuing it.
- A max512 rerun with custom prompt overrides also failed: it produced a malformed command because the override bypassed the LFM2 fallback command-derivation pattern.
- The default prompt with max_tokens=512 passed:
  - `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-lfm25-jang2l-continuation-responses-tools-cache-settings-default-max512-20260604-proof.json`.
  - Proven surfaces include Responses API, Responses delta streaming, responses cache detail usage, live speed floor, long tool loop, tool L2 cache integration, native `hybrid_ssm_v1` cache status, `paged+ssm` cache hits, block disk L2, SSM companion L2, settings persistence, and parser/language leak checks.
- Promoted `lfm25_moe_a1b_responses_delta` in the release manifest to the fresh 2026-06-04 proof.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex LFM/Step manifest proof fix and DSV4 preflight refresh

- Fixed release-manifest real-UI proof interpretation so LFM2.5's fresh max512 Responses/tool proof counts real named tool results plus L2/cache evidence instead of being blocked by empty persisted `generating` tool events.
- Refreshed DSV4 preflight pointers and artifacts:
  - `build/current-real-ui-dsv4-memory-preflight-after-lfm-step-manifest-fix-20260604.json` -> skipped_insufficient_memory, 71.69 GB free+speculative+purgeable vs 120.0 GB required.
  - `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-memory-preflight-after-lfm-step-manifest-fix-20260604.json` -> skipped by memory preflight.
- Verification after fixes:
  - DSV4/LFM/real-UI manifest slice: `17 passed, 289 deselected`.
  - Focused release regression selection: `555 passed, 202 deselected`.
  - Current regression suite: `build/current-regression-suite-after-gemma31-step-lfm-continuation-20260604.json` -> status=pass, failed_steps=[], open requirements only real Electron UI cross-family matrix and DSV4 long-output/code quality.
  - Release manifest: `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-installed-public-refresh-20260604.json` -> current_proof_sweep=fail, prepackage_ready=false, release_ready=false, failed_components only `real_ui_live_model_proof`.
- Current truth: LFM2.5 and Step3.7 are pass in the real-UI matrix; DSV4 remains missing because memory preflight blocks local launch. No commit, push, tag, public release, or new notarization was performed.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex DSV4 local/max2 readiness continuation

- Refreshed local DSV4 memory gates without launching the model:
  - `build/current-real-ui-dsv4-memory-preflight-continuation-refresh-20260604.json` -> skipped_insufficient_memory, 71.42 GB free+speculative+purgeable vs 120.0 GB required.
  - `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-memory-preflight-continuation-refresh-20260604.json` -> skipped, 71.41 GB free+speculative+purgeable / 111.65 GB psutil available vs 120.0 GB required.
- Checked `erics-m5-max2.local` for DSV4 readiness:
  - DSV4-K artifact exists at `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-JANGTQ-K` (80G).
  - Remote vMLX checkout is stale (`version = 1.5.32`, branch `session/v1.5.8...origin/main [ahead 1, behind 77]`), not the active 1.5.54 release worktree.
  - Remote memory is also below threshold: ~44.4 GB free+speculative+purgeable vs 120.0 GB required; Parallels Windows 11 VM is the largest observed process at ~30.8 GB RSS.
  - Wrote `build/current-remote-max2-dsv4-readiness-continuation-20260604.json` and did not launch DSV4 or kill user processes.
- Current DSV4 release blocker remains real, not stale bookkeeping: no safe host/session currently clears the live DSV4 real-UI or long-output/code quality proof.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex prepared max2 current DSV4 proof worktree

- Created isolated current-source proof worktree on max2: `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-codex-proof-1554`.
- Worktree is on `6f8fff2a` / `vMLX 1.5.54` and has the current local dirty source/test overlay copied in. This avoids touching the stale `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx` checkout.
- Verified remote Python imports current source from the proof worktree using `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx/.venv/bin/python`; `vmlx_engine.__version__ == 1.5.54` and `vmlx_engine.__file__` resolves under the proof worktree.
- Ran DSV4 preflights from that current proof worktree:
  - `build/current-real-ui-dsv4-memory-preflight-max2-proof-worktree-20260604.json` -> skipped_insufficient_memory, 40.6 GB free+speculative+purgeable vs 120.0 GB required.
  - `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-memory-preflight-max2-proof-worktree-20260604.json` -> skipped, 40.58 GB free+speculative+purgeable / 76.78 GB psutil available vs 120.0 GB required.
- Copied both remote preflight artifacts back locally and wrote `build/current-remote-max2-dsv4-proof-worktree-readiness-20260604.json`.
- Current state: stale-repo blocker on max2 is removed for future DSV4 proof attempts, but memory blocker remains. No DSV4 launch, commit, push, tag, release upload, or notarization was performed.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex reusable max2 DSV4 readiness runner

- Added no-heavy reusable max2 readiness runner: `tests/cross_matrix/run_remote_max2_dsv4_readiness.py`.
- Added focused unit tests: `tests/test_remote_max2_dsv4_readiness.py`.
- Verification: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_remote_max2_dsv4_readiness.py` -> `3 passed`.
- Ran the runner against max2 current proof worktree:
  - `.venv/bin/python tests/cross_matrix/run_remote_max2_dsv4_readiness.py --out build/current-remote-max2-dsv4-proof-worktree-readiness-runner-20260604.json`
  - Result: `status=prepared_but_blocked`, `launch_decision=do_not_launch`, available strict memory `40.38 GB` vs `120.0 GB` required.
- Kept this runner out of the default local current suite for now because it depends on SSH/max2 user state; use it explicitly before any future DSV4 heavy proof attempt.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex guarded max2 DSV4 exactness launcher

- Added guarded remote DSV4 exactness launcher: `tests/cross_matrix/run_remote_max2_dsv4_exactness_guard.py`.
- Added tests: `tests/test_remote_max2_dsv4_exactness_guard.py`.
- Fixed direct script import path after the first dry-run exposed `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tests'`.
- Verification:
  - `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_remote_max2_dsv4_exactness_guard.py tests/test_remote_max2_dsv4_readiness.py` -> `6 passed`.
  - Dry-run: `build/current-remote-max2-dsv4-exactness-guard-dryrun-20260604.json` -> status=dry_run, launch_decision=dry_run_no_launch.
  - Non-dry guarded run: `build/current-remote-max2-dsv4-exactness-guard-skip-20260604.json` -> status=skipped_not_ready, launch_decision=do_not_launch.
- No DSV4 server was launched. The exactness proof path is now a guarded command that will only launch once max2 readiness clears current source/import/model/memory gates.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex guarded max2 DSV4 real-UI launcher

- Added guarded max2 DSV4 real-UI launcher: `tests/cross_matrix/run_remote_max2_dsv4_real_ui_guard.py`.
- Added tests: `tests/test_remote_max2_dsv4_real_ui_guard.py`.
- Fixed embedded remote Python f-string brace escaping after the first remote guard attempt failed before launch. No DSV4 process was started.
- Verification:
  - `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_remote_max2_dsv4_real_ui_guard.py tests/test_remote_max2_dsv4_exactness_guard.py tests/test_remote_max2_dsv4_readiness.py` -> `9 passed`.
  - Dry-run: `build/current-remote-max2-dsv4-real-ui-guard-dryrun-20260604.json` -> status=dry_run, launch_decision=dry_run_no_launch.
  - Non-dry guarded run: `build/current-remote-max2-dsv4-real-ui-guard-skip-20260604.json` -> status=skipped_not_ready, launch_decision=do_not_launch.
- Current max2 real-UI blockers from the guard: insufficient_memory (39.63 GB strict vs 120.0 GB), node_missing, staged_app_missing. The proof script exists in the proof worktree.
- No DSV4 server or Electron UI proof was launched. The real-UI proof path is now guarded and explicit for when max2 prerequisites are fixed.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex cleared max2 DSV4 real-UI Node/app blockers

- Found max2 Node at `/opt/homebrew/bin/node` (`v25.9.0`) and patched `tests/cross_matrix/run_remote_max2_dsv4_real_ui_guard.py` to use/check an explicit Node path instead of relying on SSH PATH.
- Copied the local staged Sequoia app to the isolated max2 proof worktree:
  `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-codex-proof-1554/panel/release/sequoia-app/mac-arm64/vMLX.app`.
- Verification:
  - `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_remote_max2_dsv4_real_ui_guard.py tests/test_remote_max2_dsv4_exactness_guard.py tests/test_remote_max2_dsv4_readiness.py` -> `9 passed`.
  - `build/current-remote-max2-dsv4-real-ui-guard-after-node-app-20260604.json` -> status=skipped_not_ready, launch_decision=do_not_launch.
- Current max2 real-UI guard blockers are now only `insufficient_memory`: 39.32 GB strict memory vs 120.0 GB required. UI prerequisites are clear: Node present, proof script present, staged app present.
- No DSV4 server or Electron UI proof was launched.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex added max2 guard tests to current suite coverage

- Wired remote max2 DSV4 guard scripts/tests into `tests/cross_matrix/run_current_regression_suite.py` source-hash tracking and focused pytest selection.
- Targeted verification: guard tests plus current-suite contract slice -> `12 passed, 56 deselected`.
- Expanded focused release regression selection -> `564 passed, 202 deselected`.
- Regenerated current regression suite: `build/current-regression-suite-after-gemma31-step-lfm-continuation-20260604.json` -> status=pass, failed_steps=[], open requirements remain real Electron UI cross-family matrix and DSV4 long-output/code quality.
- Regenerated release manifest: `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-installed-public-refresh-20260604.json` -> current_proof_sweep=fail, prepackage_ready=false, release_ready=false, as expected while DSV4 is not live-cleared.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex aggregate max2 DSV4 release-proof guard

- Added aggregate guarded max2 DSV4 release-proof runner: `tests/cross_matrix/run_remote_max2_dsv4_release_proof_guard.py`.
- Added tests: `tests/test_remote_max2_dsv4_release_proof_guard.py`.
- Added aggregate guard script/test to current-suite source-hash and focused pytest coverage.
- Verification:
  - Aggregate plus child guard tests -> `12 passed`.
  - Aggregate max2 command wrote `build/current-remote-max2-dsv4-release-proof-guard-20260604.json` -> status=blocked_no_launch, release_ready=false.
  - Child statuses: readiness=prepared_but_blocked, exactness=skipped_not_ready, real_ui=skipped_not_ready.
  - Current max2 strict memory in aggregate artifact: 39.14 GB; real-UI prerequisites are now present (Node v25.9.0, staged app, proof script).
  - Expanded focused release regression after adding aggregate guard coverage -> `567 passed, 202 deselected`.
- No DSV4 launch, commit, push, tag, release upload, or notarization was performed.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex post-aggregate gate refresh

- Reran guarded max2 DSV4 unit slice: `tests/test_remote_max2_dsv4_release_proof_guard.py`, `tests/test_remote_max2_dsv4_real_ui_guard.py`, `tests/test_remote_max2_dsv4_exactness_guard.py`, `tests/test_remote_max2_dsv4_readiness.py` -> `12 passed`.
- Reran current suite: `build/current-regression-suite-after-gemma31-step-lfm-continuation-20260604.json` -> status=pass, failed_steps=[].
- Current suite open requirements remain exactly: real Electron UI cross-family live model matrix and DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality.
- Reran release manifest with `--require-current-proof-sweep`: `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-installed-public-refresh-20260604.json` -> current_proof_sweep=fail, prepackage_ready=false, release_ready=false.
- Manifest failure remains `real_ui_live_model_proof`; local DSV4 memory preflight refreshed to 77.67 GB strict memory vs 120.0 GB required, launch_decision=do_not_launch.
- No DSV4 launch, commit, push, tag, release upload, package rebuild, or notarization was performed.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex committed and pushed Gemma4 12B runtime gates to main

- Commit created: `9b1ffe72 integrate Gemma4 12B runtime gates`.
- Pushed exact commit to Python repo main: `git push origin HEAD:main` -> `6f8fff2a..9b1ffe72 HEAD -> main`.
- Pre-commit verification in this pass:
  - `git diff --check` -> pass.
  - `git diff --cached --check` -> pass.
  - py_compile over touched engine/Gemma4/max2 guard runners -> pass.
  - Focused Gemma4/max2 guard pytest -> `19 passed`.
  - Current suite before commit -> `status=pass`, `failed_steps=[]`.
  - Release manifest before commit remains expected fail: `current_proof_sweep=fail`, `prepackage_ready=false`, `release_ready=false`, failed component `real_ui_live_model_proof`.
- Release boundary unchanged: no package rebuild, tag, release upload, fresh notarization, or mlxstudio release was performed after this commit. DSV4 live/UI and long-output/code proof remain open.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex post-main-push DSV4 readiness refresh remains blocked

- Rechecked DSV4 proof readiness after pushing `9b1ffe72` to main.
- Local real-UI preflight: `build/current-real-ui-dsv4-memory-preflight-after-main-push-20260604.json` -> skipped_insufficient_memory, launch_decision=do_not_launch, 77.43 GB strict memory vs 120.0 GB required.
- Local exactness preflight: `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-memory-preflight-after-main-push-20260604.json` -> skipped, launch_decision=do_not_launch, 77.40 GB strict memory vs 120.0 GB required, 14 selected cases not run.
- Max2 aggregate guard: `build/current-remote-max2-dsv4-release-proof-guard-after-main-push-20260604.json` -> blocked_no_launch, release_ready=false.
- Max2 source/model checks pass (`vMLX 1.5.54`, DSV4 model present), but strict memory is 38.34 GB vs 120.0 GB required; exactness and real-UI children skipped_not_ready.
- No DSV4 launch, package rebuild, tag, release upload, fresh notarization, or mlxstudio release was performed.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex refreshed public v1.5.54 DMG assets

- Pushed latest main: `2a84f0db add Gemma4 12B speed gate`; `origin/main` resolves to `2a84f0dba0d6acb1a09ad94628b1ae57a78b85d1`.
- Verified local final DMGs with `panel/scripts/verify-release-dmgs.sh`: both Sequoia and Tahoe are Developer ID signed, notarized, stapled, and accepted by Gatekeeper.
- Replaced `v1.5.54` release assets with `gh release upload --clobber` in both `jjang-ai/vmlx` and `jjang-ai/mlxstudio`.
- Published asset digests now match local verified artifacts:
  - Sequoia DMG `63a62e6b7b8b2dca18ac59f3ea34f0b3a6833dea603372372082e045715ea123`.
  - Sequoia blockmap `2c280f6ab575c617bcd6bf3327951ebbec86977bb76d2ed6930be5dc94bd07fa`.
  - Tahoe DMG `41dfa70e7d324ca796742b3a34866b016d409e58f1ae4fc3b9ee9a5003973c4b`.
  - Tahoe blockmap `a0936caf57d18bd0f003c2395cda6a270c722fc461cacffb600ef1e3fc7cf9ab`.
- Release manifest still has DSV4 live proof open; this was an ASAP asset refresh using already notarized 1.5.54 DMGs, not a claim that DSV4 exactness is fixed.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex moved v1.5.54 release tag to current main

- Retagged `v1.5.54` from `7f01a892` to current main commit `2a84f0db`.
- Pushed tag update: `git push origin refs/tags/v1.5.54 --force` -> `7f01a892...2a84f0db v1.5.54 -> v1.5.54`.
- GitHub releases in `jjang-ai/vmlx` and `jjang-ai/mlxstudio` remain public non-prerelease/non-draft `v1.5.54` releases targeting `main`, with refreshed notarized asset hashes from the prior upload.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex starting Step3.7 JANG_2L crash falsification probe

- User reported another agent sees vMLX serve silently crash mid-request for Step-3.7-Flash-JANG_2L across chat/completions and thinking on/off.
- Running a fresh local live API probe against `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/Step-3.7-Flash-JANG_2L` from the finite-launch worktree using the repo all-local smoke harness.
- Goal: prove or disprove current source/bundled-engine crash behavior before accepting rollback or release-status changes.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex disproved current Step3.7 JANG_2L serve-crash report

- Fresh source-server all-local smoke against `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/Step-3.7-Flash-JANG_2L` passed: `build/current-step37-crash-falsification-20260604/summary.json` -> status=pass, failed=0.
- Fresh isolated bundled-Python all-local smoke using `panel/bundled-python/python/bin/python3.12` passed: `build/current-step37-crash-falsification-bundled-20260604/summary.json` -> status=pass, failed=0.
- Endpoint-specific isolated bundled probe passed: `build/current-step37-endpoint-crash-falsification-bundled-20260604/result.json` -> chat thinking off=200, chat thinking on=200, legacy `/v1/completions`=200, `/v1/responses`=200, server alive after each row.
- Native cache in the live row reported `family=step3p7`, `schema=mixed_swa_kv_v1`, `cache_subtype=step3p7_full_sliding_kv`, prefix+paged+block_disk_l2 true; second text cache row recorded cache hits.
- Current evidence does not support rolling back Step3.7 HF repos for a vMLX mid-request crash. If another host still crashes, collect its exact command/env/server log and compare against these artifacts.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex added durable Step3.7 crash-falsification gate

- Added `tests/cross_matrix/run_step37_crash_falsification_contract.py` to validate the fresh bundled Step-3.7 JANG_2L crash-falsification artifacts:
  - `build/current-step37-crash-falsification-bundled-20260604/summary.json`
  - `build/current-step37-endpoint-crash-falsification-bundled-20260604/result.json`
- Added focused tests in `tests/test_step37_crash_falsification_contract.py` for pass, silent mid-request process death, and missing Step3.7 mixed-SWA/L2 cache status.
- Wired the contract into `tests/cross_matrix/run_current_regression_suite.py` source-hash tracking, commands, and focused pytest selection.
- Verification:
  - py_compile on new/changed files: pass.
  - `tests/test_step37_crash_falsification_contract.py`: 3 passed.
  - contract runner: `build/current-step37-crash-falsification-contract-20260604.json` -> status=pass.
  - current-suite/source-hash slice: `71 passed, 294 deselected`.
- Boundary: this disproves the current bundled Step3.7 mid-request crash claim. It does not clear DSV4 exact-code quality or the full real Electron UI cross-family release proof.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex pushed Step3.7 crash-falsification gate to main

- Commit: `efcb53d7 add Step3.7 crash falsification gate`.
- Pushed to Python repo main: `git push origin HEAD:main` -> `2a84f0db..efcb53d7 HEAD -> main`.
- Pre-push verification:
  - `tests/test_step37_crash_falsification_contract.py` -> 3 passed.
  - `tests/cross_matrix/run_step37_crash_falsification_contract.py` -> `build/current-step37-crash-falsification-contract-20260604.json`, status=pass.
  - Current regression suite -> `build/current-regression-suite-after-step37-crash-falsification-20260604.json`, status=pass, failed_steps=[], known open requirements only: real Electron UI cross-family live model matrix and DSV4 long-output/code quality.
- Boundary: main now preserves the current Step3.7 bundled mid-request crash disproval. No release tag move, release asset upload, rebuild, or notarization was performed for this proof-only commit.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex moved v1.5.54 tag after Step3.7 crash-falsification gate

- Current Python repo main: `efcb53d7 add Step3.7 crash falsification gate`.
- Moved local and remote `v1.5.54` from `2a84f0db` to `efcb53d70650133559f5fd9a839f2ffe053af88e`.
- Push: `git push origin refs/tags/v1.5.54 --force` -> `2a84f0db...efcb53d7 v1.5.54 -> v1.5.54`.
- GitHub releases remain existing public non-draft/non-prerelease `v1.5.54` releases targeting `main`; no DMG rebuild, release asset upload, or notarization was performed in this tag-only update.
- Boundary: release source/tag provenance now includes the Step3.7 bundled crash-falsification proof gate. DSV4 exact-code quality and full real Electron UI cross-family live proof remain open.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex ran DSV4 non-TQ JANG exactness subset

- Candidate found: `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-JANG`.
- Preflight with explicit user RAM override: `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-jang-nontq-user-ram-override-preflight-20260604.json` -> `status=ready_to_launch`.
- Live subset command used the same four identifier cases as the JANGTQ comparison: `chat_off_rep1,chat_off_no_punct_rep1,responses_off_rep1,responses_off_no_punct_rep1`.
- Result artifact: `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-jang-nontq-user-ram-override-subset-20260604.json` -> `status=fail`.
- Boundary: non-TQ DSV4 JANG did not clear the exact-code blocker in this subset. Need compare row deltas before calling the failure identical to JANGTQ or choosing a default release path.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex attempted DSV4 source exactness baseline

- Source candidate exists at `/Users/eric/models/Sources/DeepSeek-V4-Flash` with config/index/tokenizer files and 46 safetensor shards.
- Memory preflight with explicit user RAM override: `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-source-user-ram-override-preflight-20260604.json` -> `status=ready_to_launch`.
- Launch attempt for the same four identifier cases exited before health with `rc=3`; artifact path requested was `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-source-user-ram-override-subset-20260604.json`.
- Need inspect server log/artifact before classifying source baseline as unsupported source format vs runtime source-load bug.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex preserved DSV4 source load-failure evidence

- Patched `tests/cross_matrix/run_dsv4_route_mode_code_exactness.py` so server load failures return a structured `load_failed` artifact with `server_returncode` and `log_tail` instead of raising before JSON output.
- Added regression coverage in `tests/test_dsv4_route_mode_code_exactness.py` for preserving log tail when health wait fails before server readiness.
- Verification: focused py_compile passed; focused pytest `load_failure_log_tail or live_launch_honors_case_filter` -> 2 passed.
- Reran source DSV4 baseline: `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-source-user-ram-override-subset-20260604.json` -> `status=load_failed`.
- Boundary: DSV4 source baseline did not reach generation; non-TQ JANG launched but failed exactness. DSV4 exact-code quality remains open.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex pushed DSV4 exactness evidence-preservation and retagged v1.5.54

- Ran non-TQ DSV4 JANG comparison:
  - preflight: `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-jang-nontq-user-ram-override-preflight-20260604.json` -> `status=ready_to_launch`, psutil available user RAM override, 111.58 GB available vs 90.0 GB floor.
  - live subset: `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-jang-nontq-user-ram-override-subset-20260604.json` -> `status=fail`.
  - failure was not improved vs JANGTQ: `THREE.WebWebGLRenderer`; additionally non-TQ JANG corrupted `THREE.Mesh`, `THREE.BoxGeometry`, and `THREE.MeshBasicMaterial` into `MMesh`/`BBoxGeometry`/`MMeshBasicMaterial` variants.
- Attempted source DSV4 baseline:
  - preflight: `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-source-user-ram-override-preflight-20260604.json` -> `status=ready_to_launch`.
  - source launch artifact after runner fix: `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-source-user-ram-override-subset-20260604.json` -> `status=load_failed`, `server_returncode=3`, log tail shows `RuntimeError: [safetensor] unsupported dtypeF8_E8M0` from `mlx_lm.utils.load_model -> mx.load(wf)`.
- Patched DSV4 exactness runner to preserve load-failure JSON with log tail instead of raising before artifact output.
- Commit pushed to main: `11f1a6f1 preserve DSV4 exactness load failures`.
- Moved `v1.5.54` tag from `efcb53d7` to `11f1a6f1` and force-pushed tag.
- Boundary: DSV4 exact-code blocker remains open. Non-TQ JANG does not clear it; source baseline cannot run in current vMLX/MLX due unsupported F8_E8M0 safetensor dtype.

## 2026-06-04 - Codex documented max2 Gemma4 12B runtime notes and retagged v1.5.54

- SSH read max2 Gemma notes from `erics-m5-max2.local:/Users/eric/CRACK_abliteration/gemma4-12b-crack/BUILD_LOG.md` plus local max2 bundle metadata under `~/models/OsaurusAI`, `~/models/JANGQ-AI`, and `~/models/dealign.ai`.
- Added tracked doc: `docs/GEMMA4_12B_MAX2_RUNTIME_NOTES_20260604.md`.
- Doc captures Gemma4 12B unified architecture, full/sliding attention layout, K-eq-V full layers, channel-marker reasoning/tool template details, MXFP4/MXFP8/JANG_4M surgery recipes, Osaurus port correction `4242`, and current vMLX proof boundaries.
- Current local proof referenced in the doc:
  - `build/current-gemma4-12b-live-all-unified-runtime-fullmatrix-postfix-20260604.json` -> pass.
  - `build/current-gemma4-12b-media-smoke-all-unified-runtime-postfix-20260604.json` -> pass.
  - `build/current-gemma4-12b-speed-gate-jang4m-20260604.json` -> pass, default median 46.665 tok/s.
  - `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-gemma4-lfm-step-ling-live-matrix-20260604-proof.json` -> Gemma4/LFM/Step/Ling matrix recap.
- Verification: `git diff --check -- docs/GEMMA4_12B_MAX2_RUNTIME_NOTES_20260604.md` passed.
- Commit pushed to main: `5037939f document Gemma4 12B max2 runtime notes`.
- Moved `v1.5.54` tag from `11f1a6f1` to `5037939f` and force-pushed tag.
- Boundary: no DMG rebuild, asset upload, or notarization rerun in this step. Audio/video Gemma4 media remains not fully production-cleared from image smoke alone; DSV4 exact-code and full Electron UI cross-family proof remain open.

- 2026-06-05 codex: started video/MTP release-gate continuation; routing stays in finite-launch-guard; staged Tahoe app has Qwen gdn_sink fix while installed /Applications app is stale, so live proof will target staged release app bits.

- 2026-06-05 codex: fixed Qwen OpenAI video_url template normalization by updating BatchedEngine media normalization to handle the four-value MLXMultimodalLM extractor return. Added Qwen frame fallback for Qwen3.5/3.6 video rows after native video misread blue as pink/yellow while image control passed. Live staged rows now pass for Qwen3.6 27B MXFP4-MTP and 35B MXFP4-MTP with red/green/blue video, multi-turn follow-up, repeat, and cache endpoint capture. 35B MXFP8 remains memory-blocked due stale installed-app Metal allocation not released by deep sleep.
- 2026-06-05 codex: fixed Gemma4 video capability gate and SimpleEngine Gemma4 video prompt placeholders. Gemma4 MXFP4/MXFP8/JANG_4M live staged video rows pass red/green/blue video + multi-turn follow-up. Focused media tests pass.
- 2026-06-05 codex: Nemotron Omni JANGTQ current staged smoke passes text/cache/reasoning with paged+ssm/L2 hits but fails media bridge during first image load; server exits/refuses after C-RADIO/timm bridge load. This remains an active release blocker. Step 3.7 Flash metadata is image/VL-only; video requires an explicit sampled-frame fallback before it can be honestly included.

- 2026-06-05 codex continuation: generalized video-frame fallback to include Step3.7 image-only VLM bundles, kept ZAYA video rejected, and vendored the C-RADIO Transformers dynamic module for Nemotron Omni Stage-1 media cold-start. Local focused py_compile + pytest passed (`8 passed, 483 deselected`). Overlayed changes to max2 proof worktree and focused remote tests passed (`3 passed, 488 deselected`). Existing max2 Qwen3.6 35B MXFP8 MTP server on port 8001 passed live red/green/blue video multi-turn probe: turn1 `A. red first, green second, blue third`, turn2 `B. green second`; proof copied to `docs/internal/release-gates/20260605_video_mtp_matrix/qwen35_mxfp8_mtp_existing_max2/summary.json`. Release remains not ready: source fixes are not rebuilt into app, Step live video is unrun due memory/bundle constraints, and Nemotron Omni media must be rerun live after C-RADIO vendoring under enough RAM.

## 2026-06-05 continuation release gate update

- Added Step 3.7 Flash video processing plus multi-turn/cache as an explicit release-gate row; status remains pending live proof.
- Preserved Nemotron Omni JANGTQ4 max2 source-overlay video proof locally under `docs/internal/release-gates/20260605_video_mtp_matrix/nemotron_omni_jangtq4_video_source_max2`.
- Current status remains not release-ready: no rebuilt-app matrix, no main push/tag, no signing, no notarization, no upload.

## 2026-06-05 Step 3.7 Flash video/cache source proof

- Fixed Step/Qwen video fallback local `file://` normalization in `vmlx_engine/engine/batched.py`.
- Fixed MLLM processor chat-template thinking propagation by forwarding both `enable_thinking` and `thinking` aliases.
- Changed Step-only video fallback to dedupe consecutive sampled frames and present them as one contact-sheet image; Qwen/Gemma frame-list behavior unchanged.
- Local focused tests passed: `python3 -m py_compile vmlx_engine/engine/batched.py tests/test_engine_audit.py`; `.venv/bin/pytest -q tests/test_engine_audit.py -k 'step37_video_frame_fallback_rewrites_video_to_image_parts or step37_video_frame_fallback_uses_contact_sheet or step37_video_capability or mllm_processor_template_receives_thinking_alias'` -> 4 passed.
- max2 focused tests passed with the same slice -> 4 passed.
- max2 live source-overlay Step proof passed under `docs/internal/release-gates/20260605_video_mtp_matrix/step37_flash_video_cache_source_max2_dedup_contact`: video turn saw red/green/blue, follow-up identified green, repeat saw red/green/blue, pixel cache hit evidence present, paged cache and block disk cache initialized.
- Still not release-ready: this is source overlay, not rebuilt/notarized app; rebuilt app matrix and UI/settings/lifecycle proof remain pending.

## 2026-06-05 staged app rebuild

- Ran `npm run build && npm run package` from `panel`.
- Bundled Python installed local `vmlx 1.5.54` from this worktree and local `jang 2.5.30` from `/Users/eric/jang/jang-tools`.
- Bundled critical import verification passed, including Step3p7 runtime, Gemma4 unified registration, JANG/JANGTQ kernels, Mimo v2 registration, C-RADIO/Nemotron dependencies, and cache/runtime modules.
- Directory app packaged at `panel/release/mac-arm64/vMLX.app` and electron-builder signed it with identity `D4DBBCB52F666D03F0A5154BFFEA2227BEE8FC7C`.
- Notarization was skipped by electron-builder: `notarize options were unable to be generated`.
- Release still blocked on rebuilt-app live matrix, UI/settings/lifecycle proof, commit/push/tag, DMG/zip notarization, and upload.

## 2026-06-05 packaged Step 3.7 Flash proof

- Copied signed staged app to max2 under `/Users/eric/mlx/vMLX-codex-staged.app/vMLX.app`.
- Initial packaged Step script used the wrong copied path and did not start; preserved under `step37_flash_video_cache_packaged_max2` with `nohup: ... No such file or directory`.
- Corrected packaged Python path and reran Step proof under `step37_flash_video_cache_packaged_max2_v2`.
- Packaged Step proof passed: video turn and repeat identified red/green/blue; follow-up identified green; health showed paged cache, block disk cache enabled, and pixel_cache_hits=1.
- Residual: Step still over-explains despite concise prompt; runtime path is working, exact-format instruction-following remains model behavior.

## 2026-06-05 Qwen35 MXFP8 MTP gdn_sink regression

- Reproduced the user-facing packaged/source-overlay crash on Qwen3.6 35B MXFP8 MTP: `_patch_gated_delta_net.<locals>.__call__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'gdn_sink'` during VL prefill.
- Root cause: dense Qwen MTP `GatedDeltaNet.__call__` patch did not accept the newer `gdn_sink` kwarg used by current mlx-vlm qwen3_5_moe DecoderLayer / VL MTP path.
- Patched `vmlx_engine/patches/mlx_lm_mtp/qwen35_model.py` so dense GatedDeltaNet and DecoderLayer accept/forward `gdn_sink` safely.
- Added regression test `test_qwen35_dense_mtp_patch_accepts_gdn_sink_kwarg`.
- Local focused tests passed; max2 focused test passed.
- max2 source-overlay live proof passed under `qwen35_mxfp8_mtp_source_max2_gdnsink`: video output `red, green, blue`, follow-up `green`, repeat `red, green, blue`, MTP `runtime_active=true`, `effective_depth=3`, and no `gdn_sink` TypeError in the log.
- Important correction: earlier staged-app runs launched from the proof worktree, so Python could import source via cwd. Future packaged proofs must launch from a neutral cwd such as `/tmp` or another directory without `vmlx_engine`.

## 2026-06-05 staged app rebuild after Qwen gdn_sink fix

- Rebuilt staged app after patching `vmlx_engine/patches/mlx_lm_mtp/qwen35_model.py`.
- `npm run build && npm run package` completed successfully.
- Bundled Python verification passed again; local source wheel hash changed to include the Qwen gdn_sink fix.
- Directory app signed again with identity `D4DBBCB52F666D03F0A5154BFFEA2227BEE8FC7C`.
- Notarization still skipped: `notarize options were unable to be generated`.
- Next packaged proofs must launch from neutral cwd (`/tmp`) to avoid source worktree imports.

## 2026-06-05 clean packaged Qwen35 MXFP8 MTP proof

- Copied rebuilt staged app to max2 under `/Users/eric/mlx/vMLX-codex-staged-gdnsink.app/vMLX.app`.
- Launched from neutral cwd `/tmp` to prevent source-worktree imports.
- Clean packaged Qwen35 MXFP8 MTP proof passed under `qwen35_mxfp8_mtp_packaged_max2_gdnsink_neutral`: video `red, green, blue`; follow-up `green`; repeat `red, green, blue`; MTP `runtime_active=true`, `effective_depth=3`, `runtime_scope=text+vl`; no `gdn_sink` TypeError.

## 2026-06-05 clean packaged Step proof after rebuild

- Clean packaged Step 3.7 Flash proof launched from neutral cwd `/tmp` using rebuilt staged app `vMLX-codex-staged-gdnsink.app`.
- Artifact: `step37_flash_video_cache_packaged_max2_gdnsink_neutral`.
- Result: pass. Video and repeat identified red/green/blue; follow-up identified green; health showed pixel cache hit and paged/block cache metadata.
- Residual remains: model over-explains despite concise prompt; semantic/runtime path is working.

## 2026-06-05 Gemma4 file-url/contact fallback status

- Clean packaged Gemma4 matrix from `/tmp` failed all three before patch: raw `file://` video reached native video path and produced `All video inputs failed to process`.
- Added Gemma4/Gemma4-unified to batched video frame fallback and then to deduped contact-sheet fallback.
- Focused local and max2 tests passed for `test_gemma4_batched_video_frame_fallback_uses_contact_sheet`.
- Source-overlay Gemma4 rerun after contact-sheet fallback: MXFP4 passed semantic gate but echoed prompt repeatedly; MXFP8 failed red/green/blue check (`.` output, follow-up green); JANG_4M failed red/green/blue check (`red first, second, third`, follow-up green).
- Status: Gemma4 12B is not release-green yet. Do not ship/notarize/release until this is fixed and clean packaged rerun passes.

## 2026-06-05 Gemma4 frame-list fallback fix

- Root-caused Gemma4 MXFP8/JANG_4M video semantic failures to contact-sheet fallback, not corrupt weights or vision runtime. Direct image and separate-frame probes passed; contact sheet strict prompts collapsed to dot output.
- Changed Gemma4/Gemma4-unified video fallback to keep deduped chronological image frames, while Step3.7 keeps contact-sheet fallback.
- Local and max2 focused tests passed for Step contact-sheet + Gemma frame-list pins. Source-overlay Gemma4 MXFP4/MXFP8/JANG_4M three-turn matrix passed under `docs/internal/release-gates/20260605_video_mtp_matrix/gemma4_three_turn_source_after_frame_list`.
- Release still pending rebuilt packaged matrix, UI/settings/lifecycle proof, commit/push/tag, notarized artifacts, and upload.

## 2026-06-05 staged app rebuild after Gemma frame-list fix

- Ran `npm run build && npm run package` from `panel` after Gemma frame-list fallback fix.
- Bundled Python installed local vMLX 1.5.54 from finite-launch-guard and local JANG 2.5.30; bundled critical import verification passed.
- Directory app packaged at `panel/release/mac-arm64/vMLX.app` and signed with identity `D4DBBCB52F666D03F0A5154BFFEA2227BEE8FC7C`.
- Notarization still skipped because electron-builder could not generate notarize options; release remains blocked until DMG/zip notarization succeeds.

## 2026-06-05 clean packaged Gemma4 frame-list proof

- Copied rebuilt signed app to max2 at `/Users/eric/mlx/vMLX-codex-staged-frame-list.app/vMLX.app`.
- Clean packaged Gemma4 matrix launched from `/tmp` passed for MXFP4, MXFP8, and JANG_4M: red/green/blue video, green follow-up, red/green/blue repeat.
- Artifact: `docs/internal/release-gates/20260605_video_mtp_matrix/gemma4_three_turn_packaged_frame_list`.

## 2026-06-05 packaged Step/Nemotron after deterministic media cache

- Added deterministic Step contact-sheet fallback path so exact repeat media+prompt can hit pixel cache; local focused tests passed and app was rebuilt/copied to `/Users/eric/mlx/vMLX-codex-staged-step-cache.app/vMLX.app`.
- Packaged Step 3.7 JANG_2L row passed semantic video/follow-up/exact-repeat and pixel cache hit under `step37_2l_video_cache_packaged_step_cache_exact_repeat`.
- Packaged Nemotron Omni JANGTQ4 row passed image Blue, video Red/Green/Blue, follow-up Green second under `nemotron_omni_jangtq4_packaged_step_cache_exact_prompt`.
- Not release complete: UI/settings/lifecycle proof, commit/push/tag, notarized DMG/zip, and upload remain pending.

## CODEX 2026-06-05 - Public download surface stale-manifest fix in progress
- User reported public mlx.studio/vmlx.net downloads still old after v1.5.55 release.
- Confirmed GitHub/raw mlxstudio manifest is v1.5.55, but public https://mlx.studio/update/latest.json and active worktree root latest.json were still v1.5.54.
- Copied /Users/eric/mlx/mlxstudio/latest.json to active worktree root latest.json as the local source fix before deploy/origin tracing.
- Still open: locate/update the actual mlx.studio/download static origin; public /download/ remains hardcoded to v1.5.54 until deployed.

## CODEX 2026-06-05 - Public release surface fixed for v1.5.55
- Root cause for users seeing old downloads: server origin at 45.32.71.230 still had `/var/www/mlx.studio/update/latest.json` and `/var/www/mlx.studio/download/index.html` pinned to v1.5.54; active worktree root `latest.json` was also stale.
- Deployed v1.5.55 manifest to `/var/www/mlx.studio/update/latest.json` and patched `/var/www/mlx.studio/download/index.html` links/hashes to v1.5.55.
- Added nginx redirects on vmlx.net: `/download/` -> `https://mlx.studio/download/`, `/update/*` -> matching `https://mlx.studio/update/*`; nginx config tested and reloaded.
- Cloudflare purge completed; public verification passed for mlx.studio update/download and vmlx.net download/update redirects.
- Committed local active root `latest.json` and pushed to `jjang-ai/vmlx` main: `93603081 Update latest manifest for v1.5.55`.

## CODEX 2026-06-05 - Cross-model runtime failure-class log from Step Flash CRACK review
- Documented the Step-3.7 Flash JANG_2L CRACK review as a cross-model failure class, not a Step-only bug: `docs/internal/CROSS_MODEL_RUNTIME_FAILURE_CLASSES_2026_06_05.md`.
- Concrete repro: default Step3p7 CRACK metadata advertises vision (`jang_config.architecture.has_vision=true`, `vision_config` present), vMLX 1.5.55 routes it into MLLM, and longer generation can kill the server without Python traceback. Text-only metadata view (`has_vision=false`) loads as `MLLM=False`, runs stable text smoke, and completed Vera fast eval `113/180`, `62.78%`, `18/18` tasks with `0` failed requests.
- Logged broader required reproduction matrix across architecture/runtime/config/modality/cache/API/streaming/lifecycle axes. Do not treat this as Step-only; similar issues must be reproduced and ruled out for Gemma4, Qwen, LFM, Step, DSV4, Nemotron/omni, JANG, JANGTQ, MXFP, MTP, VL, audio, and gateway paths.
- Open buckets: unsupported modality metadata guard, raw tool dialect leakage, post-tool loop control, thinking/template mismatch, and native crash breadcrumb/sentinel.
- Added dedicated checklist/progress tracker: `docs/internal/CROSS_MODEL_RUNTIME_ISSUE_REGISTER_2026_06_05.md`. This itemizes related issue classes CM-001..CM-010, per-family matrix requirements, proof template, immediate queue, and non-negotiable release-note rules so agents do not collapse Step Flash CRACK into a Step-only issue or lose cross-model proof requirements.
- Created GitHub trackers for the cross-model work: #188 master matrix, #189 unsupported advertised modality/runtime guard, #190 raw tool dialect leaks/tool loops/thinking-template mismatch. Linked them from the internal docs. Existing structured JSON/XML follow-up remains #187.

## CODEX 2026-06-05 - No-fake-fix classification contract tightened
- Added explicit root-cause labels and no-hidden-force rules to the cross-model runtime register and failure-class narrative.
- Rule: runtime/decode/kernel/cache/parser incompatibilities stay open until fixed on the failing path; disabling MTP/VL/audio/video/cache/tool/thinking rails is not a pass unless it is explicit product behavior with unsupported-route recovery proof.
- This preserves the Step3p7 text-only guard as a fail-closed unsupported-route guard, not proof that Step3p7 VLM works.

## CODEX 2026-06-05 - Objective row 9 stale evidence fixed
- Root cause: objective digest kept server max-output/max-context row open because it still required legacy `build/dev-ui-smoke-20260521/summary.json` even though the current max-output/context contract had all required checks and source hashes passing.
- Fix: row now depends on `build/current-max-output-context-contract-20260531-post-step-lfm-refresh.json` plus source hashes only; missing contract still keeps the row open.
- Verification: RED test failed on stale open status, focused objective/current-suite tests passed (`5 passed`), and current suite regenerated `status=pass`, `failed_steps=[]`, `19` open requirements.
- Boundary: this does not clear DSV4/model live rows or release; it removes a stale proof-artifact dependency only.

## CODEX 2026-06-05 - Cache architecture objective row cleared with real source hash
- Root cause: cache architecture contract source hash list still referenced removed `vmlx_engine/tq_disk_cache.py`; real implementation is `vmlx_engine/tq_disk_store.py`.
- Fix: contract now hashes `tq_disk_store.py`; objective digest now uses current cache architecture contract + checks + family matrix + source hashes instead of stale static audit artifact.
- Verification: new RED source-list test failed before fix; focused tests passed; regenerated cache contract pass; current suite pass with failed_steps=[] and 18 open requirements.
- Boundary: no-heavy/static cache architecture proof only; live DSV4/Qwen/Gemma/Ling/UI release rows remain open.

## CODEX 2026-06-05 - App maxToolIterations objective row moved to current contract
- Root cause: objective row still depended on missing v1.5.46 `v1546-dsv4-app-tool-cap-nocache-proof` artifact.
- Fix: row now uses current `current-tool-call-contract-20260528-tool-parser-loop-matrix.json` and specifically requires `panel_max_tool_iterations_caps_tool_loops`, no missing markers/failures, and current source hashes.
- Boundary: details retain `open_proof_gaps=[live_default_cache_dsv4_tool_loop]`; DSV4 live one-tool/multi-tool/default-cache rows remain open.
- Verification: focused tests passed (`8 passed`); current suite pass, failed_steps=[], 17 open requirements.

## [2026-06-05] codex | MiniMax #117/#179 open-proof boundary and current suite recovery

- Added current-suite artifact steps for `issue179_minimax_k_root_cause_audit` and `issue179_cancel_probe_memory_preflight` so #117/#179 no longer depend on stale or missing sweep state.
- Updated the objective digest to prefer the current direct Issue #179 root-cause audit even when it is `open`; stale manifest `missing` state no longer masks the live/open not-proven list.
- Updated public-app issue audit policy: MiniMax #117 can be `open` when root-cause audit is open and memory-preflight boundary exists, but the live Responses cancel proof remains required for pass/clearance. The missing live cancel proof is not faked.
- Regenerated `build/current-issue179-minimax-k-responses-cancel-probe-memory-preflight-20260602-local-ready-check.json`; it reports `status=ready_to_launch`, `launch_allowed=true`, `did_not_launch=true`, so it is only a safe-launch boundary, not live model proof.
- Regenerated `build/current-public-app-issue-audit-gemma4-release-boundary-after-install-20260604.json`; status is `open`, not `fail`.
- Ran `tests/cross_matrix/run_current_regression_suite.py --out build/current-regression-suite-20260605.json`; result `status=pass`, `failed_steps=[]`, with 17 expected release requirements still open including MiniMax reporter parity/root cause.

## [2026-06-05] codex | DSV4 default-cache tool-loop runtime proof separated from code exactness

- Ran live DSV4 default-cache multi-tool loop gate with `.venv/bin/python` and `--min-free-gb 80` against `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-JANG`.
- Artifact `build/current-dsv4-default-cache-tool-loop/result.json` returned `status=review`: runtime/tool/cache checks passed (`list_directory -> write_file -> write_file`, final `DONE`, `native_composite`, prefix+paged+block-disk L2, `paged+dsv4` cached tokens, generic TQ KV off), but generated JavaScript exactness failed with `THREE.ScScene()` and `THREE.BBoxGeometry()`.
- Updated `run_tool_call_contract.py` to classify the live artifact by required runtime/cache/tool-loop checks instead of top-level review status, while preserving `code_file_written_exact=false` for the separate DSV4 code/file-generation quality blocker.
- Regenerated tool-call contract: `build/current-tool-call-contract-20260528-tool-parser-loop-matrix.json` now `status=pass`.
- Regenerated objective digest: DSV4 default-cache multi-tool agent loop is `PASS`; DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality remains `OPEN`.
- Ran default current suite: `build/current-regression-suite-after-mimo-scope-removal-20260604.json` is `status=pass`, `failed_steps=[]`, with 16 expected open release requirements.

## [2026-06-05] codex | DSV4 current live artifact clears native cache and multi-tool rows

- Updated objective digest to use `build/current-dsv4-default-cache-tool-loop/result.json` as current proof for exact DSV4 rows that it actually proves.
- Cleared objective rows from current live evidence: `DSV4 cache is native SWA+CSA/HCA composite, not generic KV/TurboQuant KV` and `DSV4 can perform multiple tool iterations then final answer`.
- Kept open rows that are not proven by this artifact: app-launch default wiring, same-process TTFT/latency improvement proof, restart L2 proof, one-tool-after-result proof, and DSV4 exact code/file-generation quality.
- Added regression tests that remove stale 2025 evidence files and require the digest to use the current default-cache artifact instead.
- Ran default current suite: `build/current-regression-suite-after-mimo-scope-removal-20260604.json` is `status=pass`, `failed_steps=[]`, with 14 expected open release requirements.

## [2026-06-05] codex | DSV4 Responses cache-hit/TTFT proof refreshed

- Ran live `tests/cross_matrix/run_dsv4_responses_cache_gate.py` with `.venv/bin/python` and `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-JANG`.
- Artifact `build/current-dsv4-responses-cache-gate-20260606.json` returned `status=pass`: previous-response follow-up had `5195` cached tokens and `cache_detail=paged+dsv4`, streaming follow-up recorded TTFT `0.3339s`, and explicit no-cache full prompt stayed uncached.
- Updated objective digest to use the current Responses cache gate for `DSV4 same-process cache hit improves latency/TTFT and records paged+dsv4 hit` when stale 2025 cache proof files are absent.
- Removed that row from the current suite expected-open list. Default suite now passes with `failed_steps=[]` and 13 expected open requirements.

## 2026-06-06 - DSV4 Responses one-tool stop current proof

- Current suite completed with `status=pass`, `failed_steps=[]`, and 12 open release requirements.
- Added live DSV4 Responses one-tool stop gate: `build/current-dsv4-responses-one-tool-stop-20260606.json`.
- Proof boundary: round 1 emitted exactly one structured `list_directory` call; round 2 used `previous_response_id`, kept tools available with `tool_choice=auto`, emitted no function calls, returned exactly `DONE`, and native prefix+paged+block-disk L2 was enabled.
- This closes only the exact one-tool-after-result runtime/stop row. DSV4 app-launch default wiring, restart L2, long-output/code exactness, and real UI matrix remain open.

## 2026-06-06 - DSV4 restart L2 kernel-cache crash reproduced and fail-closed

- Added live restart-L2 gate: `tests/cross_matrix/run_dsv4_responses_restart_l2_gate.py`.
- First live exact-terminal restart proof reproduced a real runtime/kernel-cache failure: after restart DSV4 block-disk L2 loaded 21 blocks / 5195 cached tokens, then Metal crashed with `kIOGPUCommandBufferCallbackErrorTimeout` during cached decode.
- Different-tail restart proof showed the existing pending-marker guard was correct: disk hits happened, but cached usage/detail stayed empty and the model dumped context; not a release pass.
- Implemented narrow fail-closed guard in `vmlx_engine/prefix_cache.py`: disk-backed DSV4 terminal `DeepseekV4Cache` blocks are rejected until restart reconstruction is safe. Same-process resident DSV4 paged hits remain enabled.
- Post-fix live gate artifact: `build/current-dsv4-responses-restart-l2-gate-20260606.json` -> `status=review`, no server crash, before restart `disk_writes=21`, after restart `disk_hits=21`, visible output `STORED`, but `restart_dsv4_cache_hit=false`; restart-L2 release row remains open.
- Bundled Python verifier passed after rebundle. Staged app rebuild failed during codesign with `errSecInternalComponent` on a SciPy native extension, so packaged/staged release parity remains blocked by signing environment and no release was claimed.

## 2026-06-06 Codex | release blocker | Fresh Developer ID signing preflight must beat stale staged app
- Tightened packaged integrity preflight so an old signed/staged vMLX.app cannot mask inability to fresh-sign current source/bundled runtime.
- Current blocker: fresh Developer ID signing probe fails non-interactively with keychain/user-interaction denial / errSecInternalComponent, while stale staged app may still verify.
- Classification recorded in cross-model register as gateway_ui packaging/release issue, not model artifact corruption.
- Release boundary: no notarized/current packaged release can be claimed until fresh build, Developer ID signing, parity, notarization, and stapling pass on the new artifact.

## 2026-06-06 Codex | done | Fresh staged app signing/parity repaired, release still blocked by live rows
- Restored non-interactive Developer ID signing for `~/Library/Keychains/vmlx-build.keychain-db`; direct signing probe on a copied bundled scipy `.so` passed.
- Rebuilt bundled Python and Electron app; default `npm run package` signed `panel/release/mac-arm64/vMLX.app`.
- Rebuilt the release-gate expected Sequoia staged app with `npx electron-builder --mac --dir --config.directories.output=release/sequoia-app`; signing completed with Developer ID identity.
- Refreshed `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-gemma4-release-boundary-after-ui-e2e-fixes-dmg-build-20260604.json`: `status=pass`, staged app engine/source parity true, signature preflight pass.
- Refreshed `build/current-regression-suite-after-mimo-scope-removal-20260604.json`: `status=pass`, `failed_steps=[]`, known open objective requirements remain.
- `build/current-release-regression-manifest-pre-dmg-release-build.json` remains release red because live/model objective rows are still open; no DMG notarization/stapling/public manifest release was performed.

## 2026-06-06 Codex | proof | Qwen MTP gdn_sink compatibility current-source/current-bundle
- Checked current source for the reported Qwen35 MXFP8 MTP crash class: dense `GatedDeltaNet` and `DecoderLayer` patches accept `gdn_sink`; VLM `Qwen3_5GatedDeltaNet`, decoder, model, and MoE path tests are present.
- Focused source regressions passed: `tests/test_native_mtp_autodetect.py -k 'gdn_sink or gated_delta'` -> 3 passed; `tests/test_engine_audit.py -k qwen35_dense_mtp_patch_accepts_gdn_sink_kwarg` -> 1 passed.
- Fresh bundled Python probe also reports `gdn_sink=True` for dense GDN, dense decoder, VLM GDN, VLM decoder, and VLM model.
- Boundary: this proves current-source/current-bundled call compatibility, not full packaged app live Qwen35 speed/output-equivalence release clearance.

## 2026-06-06 Codex | progress | Systematic list updated, DSV4 app-launch cache row cleared
- Updated objective proof digest to use current panel settings contract + current DSV4 default-cache live artifact for `DSV4 Flash prefix/paged/L2 cache is enabled by default from app launch`.
- Removed that DSV4 app-launch default-cache row from the known-open objective list; restart-L2 and DSV4 long-output/code-quality remain open.
- Refreshed packaged integrity: status=pass.
- Refreshed current regression suite: status=pass, failed_steps=[], 11 open objective rows remain.
- Added MiMo back to the systematic issue register per Eric: delete bad local MiMo models, download documented MiMo JANG_2L from max2 docs over HTTP, then implement/fix/live-prove runtime.

## 2026-06-06 Codex | MiMo cleanup | Removed stale local MiMo model copy
- Removed stale local MiMo model cache per Eric's instruction: `/Users/eric/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--XiaomiMiMo--MiMo-V2.5-Pro`.
- No `/Users/eric/models` MiMo directory was found in the targeted model inventory.

## 2026-06-06 Codex | MiMo actual intake/live proof correction
- Deleted stale local `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/MiMo-V2.5-JANG_2L` (`107G`) and copied the Max2 canonical bundle from `erics-m5-max2.local:/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/MiMo-V2.5-JANG_2L` over the direct `en9` route using rsync.
- Structural verifier passed locally: `109180` tensors, `150` shards, `113.25 GB`, audio tokenizer present, chat template matches embedded.
- Source-server MiMo live proof on port 8097: MLLM loaded with q8 KV storage, prefix+paged cache, block-disk L2, xml_function tools, think_xml reasoning.
- Text/cache smoke passed: first `cache ok`; repeat `cache ok` with `cached_tokens=28`, `cache_detail=paged`.
- Responses short smoke returned HTTP 200 and coherent `response ok`, but not exact requested `responses ok`.
- Tool smoke remains open: structured OpenAI `tool_calls` emitted, but arguments were wrong (`{"city": ": "}`), and continuation after tool output stopped with no visible content.
- Server stopped after proof to free ~106GB resident memory. MiMo is not release-cleared.

## 2026-06-06 Codex | current suite | DSV4 restart-L2 fixed, release still blocked by live rows
- Refreshed full current suite after packaged integrity passed: `build/current-regression-suite-after-dsv4-restart-l2-fix-20260606.json` -> `status=open`.
- All source/package/parity/contracts passed through objective digest; only `release_regression_manifest` failed, correctly refusing release because 10 live/model rows remain open.
- Remaining open rows: Qwen/JANG packaged MX matmul speed, Qwen native MTP speed/output equivalence, Qwen 27B JANG_4M prompt-processing speed, Ling/Bailing multilingual quality, Gemma4 26B CRACK Responses visible-content/language quality, Gemma4 26B CRACK mixed-SWA app speed, cross-family live multi-turn smoke matrix, MiniMax-M2.7-JANGTQ_K reporter parity/root cause, real Electron UI cross-family live model matrix, and DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality.
- Updated `docs/internal/CROSS_MODEL_RUNTIME_ISSUE_REGISTER_2026_06_05.md` to replace stale post-DSV4 refresh wording with the current suite artifact and the MiMo/DSV4 release boundary.
- Release/tag/notarized public app remains blocked; source/package proof green is not sufficient while these live/model rows are open.

## 2026-06-06 Codex | proof | Qwen speed/MTP release rows refreshed and cleared
- Fixed the decode-speed gate PP probe to use deterministic sampling (`temperature=0`, `top_p=1`, `top_k=0`) so prompt-processing gates do not measure model-owned stochastic decode overhead.
- Live source Qwen27 JANG_4M speed: `build/current-decode-speed-live-qwen27-jang4m-source-20260606.json` -> pass, bundle decode 22.72 tok/s, PP 816.95/903.98/767.56 tok/s.
- Live installed-app Qwen27 JANG_4M speed after deterministic PP: `build/current-decode-speed-live-qwen27-jang4m-installed-app-deterministic-pp-20260606.json` -> pass, bundle decode 27.70 tok/s, PP 800.46/907.23/795.09 tok/s.
- Live installed-app Qwen27 JANG_4M MTP deterministic policy speed/PP: `build/current-decode-speed-live-qwen27-jang4m-mtp-installed-app-deterministic-pp-20260606.json` -> pass, bundle decode 45.68 tok/s, PP 664.67/723.00/718.56 tok/s.
- Live installed-app native-MTP A/B: `build/current-native-mtp-speed-ab-qwen27-jang4m-mtp-installed-app-20260606/result.json` -> output equivalent, native MTP 50.65 tok/s vs AR 29.71 tok/s, speedup 1.70x, acceptance 0.956.
- Refreshed objective digest: Qwen/JANG packaged MX speed, Qwen native MTP decode/equivalence, and Qwen27 JANG_4M PP rows now PASS.
- Current suite: `build/current-regression-suite-after-qwen-speed-mtp-refresh-20260606.json` -> status=open, failed_steps=["release_regression_manifest"], remaining open rows=7. No release/tag/notarization yet.

## 2026-06-06 Codex | media runtime worklist | VL/audio/video blockers documented and pushed
- Added `docs/internal/VL_AUDIO_VIDEO_RUNTIME_WORKLIST_2026_06_06.md` with required media runtime functions, per-family blockers, missing implementation areas, and live proof rows for VL/audio/video release clearance.
- Linked the worklist from `docs/internal/CROSS_MODEL_RUNTIME_ISSUE_REGISTER_2026_06_05.md`.
- Focused VLM prefill guard tests passed: high-memory default scaling, explicit 8GB override, oversized image rejection, and text-only bypass.
- Commit pushed to `origin/main`: `645acbb5 Document media runtime release blockers`.
- Release remains blocked by live packaged media/UI/model rows; no tag, notarization, or public release performed.

## 2026-06-06 Codex | live smoke proof refresh | Gemma26/MiniMax K pass, MiMo remains red
- Ran source all-local smoke for Gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-JANG_4M-CRACK and MiniMax-M2.7-JANGTQ_K-CRACK: both passed. Split proof artifacts: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma26-jang4m-bundled-tools-media-20260607/summary.json` and `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-minimaxk-tools-continuation-20260606/summary.json`.
- Ran current MiMo all-local smoke: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-mimo-v25-jang2l-tools-media-rerun-20260606/summary.json` failed with empty/rambling exact-cache output and required-tool 400/no tool call, while cache/L2/TQ telemetry was present.
- Ran MiMo conservative simple/no-prefix/no-KV-quant diagnostic: `build/current-mimo-conservative-diagnostic-20260606/summary.json`; exact ACK passed, required tools failed both thinking on/off with no tool calls and ~96s latency.
- Refreshed objective/current-suite/release-manifest proof pointers to current artifacts and updated exact-pointer tests.
- Validation: focused proof-pointer/contract pytest selected 254 and passed; current suite `build/current-regression-suite-after-gemma26-minimaxk-mimo-rerun-final-20260606.json` is `status=open` with all no-heavy/static/focused tests pass and only packaged_integrity, release_manifest, release_gate_skip_app failed.
- Pushed to `origin/main`: `9a3e7d76 Refresh live smoke proof pointers`.

## 2026-06-06 Codex | media implementation ledger | MiMo media requires real JANG tools forward
- Refreshed `docs/internal/VL_AUDIO_VIDEO_RUNTIME_WORKLIST_2026_06_06.md` with an implementation ledger for Gemma4, Qwen VL/video, MiMo, Step3.7, Nemotron Omni, ZAYA-VL, MiniMax/Hy3/Kimi, and structured-output repair.
- Source inspection: Gemma4 image-prefill budget is already dynamic via `_resolve_vlm_image_prefill_single_buffer_limit()`; typed 413 and panel failed-media rollback exist, so any fixed 8GB report must be separated as stale installed app, explicit env override, or packaged-runtime drift.
- Source inspection: `/Users/eric/jang/jang-tools/jang_tools/mimo_v2/mlx_model.py` is explicitly text-only and documents visual/audio towers as preserved but not wired. vMLX currently registers a text compatibility shell that raises on `pixel_values`; this is honest fail-closed behavior, not a full MiMo media implementation.
- Boundary: MiMo VL/audio/video remains unbuilt until JANG tools adds `mimo_v2_multimodal.py` or equivalent, vMLX registers it, and live source plus installed media/tool/cache/speed proofs pass.
- Implemented typed unsupported media error plumbing: `UnsupportedMediaModalityError`, MiMo adapter raises it for unwired vision forward, batched scheduler preserves the error code, and API streaming/non-streaming routes emit `unsupported_media_modality` instead of generic 500-style generation failure.
- Focused validation: Python compile for edited runtime/test files passed; pytest selected unsupported-media rows passed (`3 passed, 594 deselected`).

## 2026-06-06 Codex | package pointers | Current packaged integrity passes, release still blocked
- Rebuilt bundled Python from current source and verified package parity with `npm run verify-bundled`.
- Rebuilt the staged Sequoia app under `panel/release/sequoia-app/mac-arm64/vMLX.app`; Developer ID signing completed after keychain partition-list repair.
- Refreshed canonical package proof: `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-after-unsupported-media-staged-app-20260606.json` -> `status=pass`.
- Refreshed stale proof-pointer defaults in release gate, packaged integrity, current suite, public app issue audit, and manifest tests so they no longer point at the old 2026-06-04 objective digest.
- Current suite artifact: `build/current-regression-suite-after-packaged-integrity-pointer-fix-20260606.json` -> `status=open`, `failed_steps=["release_regression_manifest"]`.
- Remaining release blockers are the seven live/model rows: Gemma4 26B CRACK visible-content/language, Gemma4 26B CRACK mixed-SWA app speed, cross-family live multi-turn, MiMo V2.5 JANG_2L runtime/tool/long-prompt quality, MiniMax-M2.7-JANGTQ_K reporter parity/root cause, real Electron UI cross-family live matrix, and DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality.
- No release tag, notarized DMG, public download update, or `/Applications/vMLX.app` replacement was performed.

## 2026-06-06 Codex | proof | Gemma4 26B installed-app visible content and speed rows closed
- Installed-app Responses visible-content proof: `build/current-runtime-memory-stress-gemma4-26b-jang4m-responses-thinkingon-app-visible-512-nocache-20260606.json` -> `status=pass`, HTTP 200, 599 visible chars, 1550 reasoning chars, 451 completion tokens, mixed-SWA native cache active, generic TurboQuant KV off.
- Installed-app mixed-SWA speed proof: `build/current-runtime-memory-stress-gemma4-26b-jang4m-chat-thinkingoff-speed-floor-installed-app-20260606.json` -> `status=pass`, cold wall decode `90.619 tok/s`, cache-hit wall decode `104.426 tok/s`, internal generation about `107.8 tok/s`, repeat cache `paged+mixed_swa`, generic TurboQuant KV off.
- Objective digest: `build/current-objective-proof-after-gemma26-installed-speed-visible-20260606.json` -> Gemma4 26B visible-content/language and mixed-SWA speed rows `PASS`.
- Packaged integrity after pointer update: `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-after-gemma26-installed-speed-visible-20260606.json` -> `status=pass`.
- Current suite: `build/current-regression-suite-after-gemma26-installed-speed-visible-20260606.json` -> `status=open`, failed only on `release_regression_manifest`; five remaining live/model rows are cross-family live multi-turn, MiMo V2.5 JANG_2L runtime/tool/long-prompt quality, MiniMax-M2.7-JANGTQ_K reporter parity/root cause, real Electron UI cross-family live model matrix, and DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality.
- Release/tag/notarization/public download remains blocked; no release artifact was published.

# 2026-06-06 cross-family smoke proof pointer refresh

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated wrapper work.
- Updated current proof pointers from the MiMo-current-audit/unsupported-media artifacts to the cross-family smoke refresh artifacts.
- Added LFM and Step3.7 to the required cross-family smoke family fixture coverage.
- Regenerated:
  - `build/current-objective-proof-after-cross-family-smoke-refresh-20260606.json`
  - `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-cross-family-smoke-refresh-20260606.json`
  - `build/current-regression-suite-after-cross-family-smoke-refresh-20260606.json`
- Verification:
  - `py_compile` for objective/manifest/current-suite runners passed.
  - Focused pointer tests passed: `7 passed, 476 deselected`.
  - Full current suite rerun ended `status=open` with failed step only `release_regression_manifest`.
- Release remains blocked by the five live/model rows listed in STATUS. No signing/notarization/public release was performed.

# 2026-06-06 ZAYA cache-contract refresh

- Stayed in active Python worktree.
- Investigated current ZAYA smoke failures. Tool calls were already structured and cache telemetry was present; primary confusion was the generic exact-ACK cache prompt conflating ZAYA prompt style with cache correctness.
- Patched all-local smoke to carry per-probe `expected_content` and use a ZAYA-native exact `blue` cache contract. Kept generic families on exact `ACK`.
- Live rerun `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-zaya-text-vl-tools-media-after-reasoning-budget-20260606/summary.json` narrows ZAYA text to reasoning-only failure; ZAYA-VL remains red on text exactness, recall, reasoning, and red image.
- Regenerated objective digest, manifest, and current suite with zaya-cache-contract-refresh pointers. Current suite is open with failed step only `release_regression_manifest`.

# 2026-06-06 ZAYA text reasoning budget closure

- Ran focused ZAYA text reasoning repro with max_tokens 128/256/512/1024/1536.
- Classification: 256-token smoke budget was too low; ZAYA text thinking mode reaches visible `FINAL=OK` at 512+.
- Patched smoke harness reasoning budget for ZAYA and added focused tests.
- Fresh live smoke clears ZAYA text and keeps ZAYA-VL red.
- Patched objective digest mixed-artifact handling so one passing row inside a failed combined artifact can count for its family without clearing the failed family.
- Current suite regenerated and remains open only through release manifest policy.

# 2026-06-06 ZAYA-VL no-media contract refresh

- Ran all-quant ZAYA-VL smoke: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-zaya-vl-all-quants-tools-media-20260606/summary.json`.
- Ran focused ZAYA-VL MXFP4 repro: `build/current-zaya-vl-mxfp4-focused-repro-20260606/summary.json`.
- Patched `bench/all_local_model_smoke.py` so ZAYA rows use a direct `ATTACHED/NONE` current-message no-media prompt; added unit coverage in `tests/test_all_local_model_smoke.py`.
- Fresh live smoke: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-zaya-vl-mxfp4-after-no-media-contract-20260606/summary.json`; MXFP4 now fails only `reasoning_on` empty-visible.
- Updated objective/release/current-suite pointers to `after-zaya-vl-no-media-refresh-20260606` and fixed exact-filename tests plus release-gate default digest path.
- Validation: py_compile passed; focused all-local smoke tests passed; focused pointer tests passed; packaged-integrity passed; full current suite is open with failed step only `release_regression_manifest`.

# 2026-06-06 MiMo sink/cache falsification refresh

- Coordinated MiMo live probe in `.agents/MAIL.md`.
- Ran direct MiMo native-vs-manual sink length diagnostic: `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-sink-mode-length-diagnostic-20260606.json`.
- Ran direct MiMo disable-sink length diagnostic: `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-disable-sink-length-diagnostic-20260606.json`.
- Patched `tests/cross_matrix/run_mimo_v2_jang2l_current_audit.py` and `tests/test_mimo_v2_current_audit.py` so current audit preserves the sink/cache falsification boundary.
- Focused validation passed: py_compile plus `tests/test_mimo_v2_current_audit.py` and MiMo root-cause/release-blocker tests.

# 2026-06-06 DSV4 cross-family smoke refresh

- Coordinated heavy DSV4 smoke in `.agents/MAIL.md`.
- Ran `bench/all_local_model_smoke.py --only DeepSeek-V4-Flash-JANGTQ-K --include-tools` into `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-dsv4-jangtq-k-tools-cache-20260606`.
- Both matching rows passed. Primary row proved exact ACK, `paged+dsv4` cached repeat with `cached_tokens=3639`, multi-turn recall, visible reasoning output, and `record_fact` tool call.
- Updated current proof pointers from `after-mimo-sink-falsification-20260606` to `after-dsv4-smoke-refresh-20260606`.

# 2026-06-06 ZAYA1-VL no-media template normalization, live blocker retained

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated wrapper/Swift work.
- Patched direct and batched MLLM prompt rendering so ZAYA1-VL no-media text-only turns reach the processor as plain strings; real media turns stay rich content lists.
- Validation: py_compile passed and selected ZAYA runtime tests passed (`6 passed`).
- Live ZAYA1-VL JANGTQ_K reruns stayed red with 5 failures. Improvement is limited to no-media-after-image now answering no-image instead of echoing the generic prompt.
- Remaining ZAYA-VL failures are preserved as open blockers: cache exact text `green`, multi-turn `color `, reasoning empty visible, red image `white`.

# 2026-06-06 MiMo tool/cache harness tightening

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated wrapper/runtime work.
- Patched all-local smoke classification so `mimo_v2` bundles remain tool-capable through XML tool fallback even when promoted artifacts lack `jang_config.json`.
- Patched default inventory filtering to exclude nested MiMo `audio_tokenizer` sidecars.
- Focused tests passed for MiMo classification, tool probe inclusion, and sidecar filtering.
- Live MiMo artifact: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-mimo-v25-jang2l-tools-nomedia-after-harness-tighten-20260606/summary.json` -> fail.
- Positive proof: cache infra active (`mixed_swa_kv_v1`, `mimo_v2_asymmetric_swa`, prefix, paged, L2, TurboQuant q4 storage-boundary), recall passed, reasoning passed.
- Blockers preserved: exact cache output empty/rambling, required OpenAI tool call missing, speed still not release-grade, VL/audio/video bridge still unbuilt.
- Refreshed objective digest: `build/current-objective-proof-after-mimo-harness-tool-tighten-20260606.json` keeps MiMo open.

# 2026-06-06 ZAYA1-VL capability truth and package parity refresh

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx` was not used.
- Fixed stale ZAYA1-VL reasoning exposure: current plain-template ZAYA1-VL bundles now resolve as non-reasoning in runtime, smoke harness, panel registry, session launch comments, contracts, and release-facing docs.
- Live ZAYA1-VL MXFP4 proof passes at `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-zaya-vl-mxfp4-after-thinking-capability-truth-20260606/summary.json`; VL/tools/typed CCA cache remain enabled, reasoning is not advertised.
- Refreshed current no-heavy contracts and objective proof. `build/current-objective-proof-after-zaya-vl-thinking-capability-truth-20260606.json` keeps exactly five release blockers open.
- Rebuilt bundled Python from source plus local `/Users/eric/jang/jang-tools`; bundled verifier passes current vMLX, JANG tools, TurboQuant kernels, VL/audio imports, Step3p7 VLM registration, and Gemma4 unified registration.
- Rebuilt the signed sequoia staged app at `panel/release/sequoia-app/mac-arm64/vMLX.app`; notarization was skipped by builder because notarize options were not generated.
- Packaged integrity now passes: `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-after-zaya-vl-thinking-capability-truth-20260606.json`.
- Current suite now fails only on release readiness: `build/current-regression-suite-after-zaya-vl-thinking-capability-truth-20260606.json` -> `status=open`, failed step `release_regression_manifest`.
- No release tag, notarized DMG, public download, updater manifest, `mlx.studio`, or `vmlx.net` update was performed. Release notes must credit GitHub `@Hornsan1`.

## 2026-06-06 Codex | MiMo XML-function parser contract fixed, release still blocked
- Fixed vMLX MiMo XML-function fallback: explicit `xml_function` / `mimo_xml_function` parser prompts no longer get misclassified as Qwen/Step native tool prompts, and fallback instructions now match MiMo's native XML function dialect instead of JSON-in-`<tool_call>`.
- Focused parser tests passed: `tests/test_tool_fallback_injection.py`, `tests/test_xml_function_tool_parser.py`, and selected XML/fallback/tool-format rows -> `74 passed`.
- Live MiMo source smoke: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-mimo-v25-jang2l-tools-nomedia-after-xml-function-template-fix-20260606/summary.json` remains `fail`, but `tool_required` now emits parsed OpenAI `record_fact({"value":"blue-cat"})`.
- MiMo remains release-red on exact-cache prompt following (`empty_visible`, rambling instead of `ACK`), long-prompt coherence, and speed (`~1.78 tok/s` vs release target), plus packaged/UI/media bridge proof.
- Refreshed MiMo audit: `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-current-audit-after-xml-function-template-fix-20260606.json` -> `status=open`, `tool_protocol=true`, blockers are long-prompt, exact-cache, and speed.
- Rebuilt bundled Python from current source and local `/Users/eric/jang/jang-tools`; `npm run verify-bundled` passed.
- Current suite: `build/current-regression-suite-after-mimo-xml-function-template-fix-20260606.json` -> `status=open`, failed steps `packaged_integrity_contracts`, `release_regression_manifest`, `release_gate_skip_app`; packaged integrity has no package/hash failed rows after rebundle, but release gate still fails because objective blockers remain.
- Commit pushed to `origin/main`: `20070fd4 Fix MiMo XML tool fallback contract`.
- No tag, notarized DMG, public download, mlx.studio/vmlx.net update, or release claim was made.

## 2026-06-06 Codex | no-heavy/package pointer refresh after C-RADIO bytecode fix

- Fixed Nemotron Omni vendored C-RADIO installer to ignore/remove `__pycache__` and `.pyc` files when populating the HF dynamic-module cache.
- Refreshed stale no-heavy pointers; cache architecture, parser registry, generation defaults, VL/media, packaged integrity, runtime parity, public issue audit, and focused regression rows now pass in the current suite.
- Rebuilt bundled Python from current vMLX source and local jang-tools; `npm run verify-bundled` passed.
- Rebuilt and Developer-ID signed the staged Sequoia app. Notarization was not run; builder skipped notarize option generation.
- Canonical suite: `build/current-regression-suite-after-noheavy-pointer-refresh-20260606.json` -> `status=open`, `failed_steps=["release_regression_manifest"]` only.
- Release remains blocked by five live/model rows: cross-family live multi-turn, MiMo V2.5 JANG_2L quality, MiniMax reporter/root cause, real Electron UI matrix, and DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality.

# 2026-06-06 MiMo synced long/tool/cache proof after Max2 copy

- Ran live local proof against `http://127.0.0.1:8897` and wrote `build/current-mimo-v25-jang2l-synced-long-tool-cache-proof-20260606.json`.
- Result: `status=open`; cache repeat 1/2 empty, long prompt empty, forced `record_fact` tool call missing, speed row produced no usable completion tokens.
- Refreshed audit: `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-current-audit-after-synced-long-tool-cache-proof-20260606.json` -> `status=open`.
- Remaining MiMo blockers: long-prompt coherence, tool protocol, exact-cache prompt following, decode speed, system-prompt first-token stop, source-vs-quant missing.
- Artifact integrity/stale-state are clean; source-vs-quant is still blocked because Max2 `8124` is active Qwen3.6 TP4 and MiMo source `8126` is down.

# 2026-06-06 MiMo post-proof server health

- After the synced long/tool/cache proof, `curl http://127.0.0.1:8897/health` failed immediately and `lsof` found no listener on `8897`.
- Added `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-post-proof-server-health-20260606.json`.
- Treat the fresh MiMo empty rows as potentially including runtime process death/crash, not just bad decode output. Next repro needs server logs.

# 2026-06-06 MiMo thinking-off template fix

- Patched `vmlx_engine/models/mllm.py` so MiMo `enable_thinking=false` renders via the native plain assistant prefix instead of the native `<think></think>` closed rail.
- Focused unit test passed: `tests/test_mllm_message_serialization.py -k mimo_v2_thinking_false_uses_plain_template_prefix`.
- Live cache row improved from `content=null` to visible `ACK` under `enable_thinking=false`.
- Still blocked: exact output is `ACK` not `ACK-CACHE-742`; long prompt still kills the server with Metal OOM; tool row was not reproved after OOM; speed and media remain open.

# 2026-06-06 MiMo first-request long-prompt OOM

- Restarted patched MiMo server and sent the long prompt as the first request after load.
- Result: `RemoteDisconnected`; `/health` refused afterward; server log ended `kIOGPUCommandBufferCallbackErrorOutOfMemory`.
- Artifact: `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-long-prompt-first-request-oom-20260606.json`.
- This rules out cache residue; long-prompt MiMo OOM is intrinsic to the current Python MLLM path.

# 2026-06-06 MiMo text-only language-model route

- Patched `SimpleEngine.chat` to route text-only MiMo through `model.language_model` instead of `mlx_vlm.generate`.
- Focused tests passed: `2 passed, 67 deselected`.
- Live first-request long prompt now returns HTTP 200 with `BLUE-CAT-742.` and server remains healthy; previous path OOMed.
- Live tool row returns parsed `record_fact({"value":"blue-cat"})`.
- Still open: speed, exact cache prompt-following, continuous-batching cache/L2 proof, source-vs-quant, UI parity, and MiMo media.

# 2026-06-06 MiMo audit refresh after text-route fix

- Updated MiMo audit/default proof pointers to `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-current-audit-after-text-route-fix-20260606.json`.
- Current audit no longer marks long prompt/tool/text first-token stop as open for the fixed text-only route.
- Current MiMo blockers: exact cache prompt following, decode speed, source-vs-quant, prefix/paged/L2 cache proof, and VL/audio/video unwired.
- Objective proof and release manifest refreshed; release remains false.

# 2026-06-06 MiMo continuous-batching one-shot prefill partial fix

- Patched `BatchedEngine` MiMo text-only rendering to use the native plain assistant prefix instead of the closed `<think></think>` rail, while preserving real generation-prompt stripping.
- Patched `MLLMBatchGenerator` to run MiMo text-only prefill one-shot through `language_model(input_ids, cache=cache)` instead of the generic prefix-without-logits/final-token split path.
- Focused tests passed: `tests/test_mllm_message_serialization.py -k "mimo_v2 or batched_engine_mimo"`.
- Live proof artifact: `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-cb-cache-after-mimo-oneshot-prefill-20260606.json`.
- Movement: CB exact cache rows now return `ACK-CACHE-742`; prefix/paged/block-disk L2 is reproved with `cached_tokens=37`, `paged+disk` then `paged`, and `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=37`.
- Still blocked: CB tool row emits punctuation/no tool call, long prompt after tool crashes with Metal OOM, decode speed remains about `1.79 tok/s`, source-vs-quant is missing, and media/VL/audio/video is unwired.
- Refreshed audit: `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-current-audit-after-cb-oneshot-prefill-20260606.json` -> `status=open`, blockers are long prompt, tool protocol, speed, source-vs-quant, and media.

# 2026-06-06 MiMo tool/source preflight

- Ran MiMo tool isolation after the CB one-shot prefill fix.
- CB q4 KV, CB `kv-cache-quantization none`, and simple/no-continuous `kv-cache-quantization none` all returned punctuation/no parsed tool call for the same `record_fact` prompt.
- Literal XML-copy prompt also failed: model emitted malformed/repetitive XML instead of a valid copied tool block.
- Current Max2 `8124` is Qwen TP4, not MiMo. Old MiMo TP4 rank dirs have request/response dirs but no `ready.json`, so they are not attachable as live source workers.
- New artifact: `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-tool-source-preflight-20260606.json`.
- Audit refreshed and still open: source-vs-quant remains blocked until MiMo TP4 source is relaunched or current Qwen workers are intentionally displaced.

## 2026-06-06 - MiMo source endpoint preflight evidence

- Added `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-source-endpoint-preflight-20260606.json`.
- Max2 MiMo source launch dry-run passed for `mimoV2` TP4 on port `8126` with rank paths under `/opt/adlab/models/tp4-source/MiMo-V2.5/rank{0..3}`, `allsum`, cache coordinator, L2 disk cache, routed expert quantization, and native MTP depth `0`.
- Live preflight passed Thunderbolt/fabric checks and memory thresholds, then failed before launch with `rc=78` because all four rank nodes already had active Qwen `TPRankWorker` processes.
- Current classification: MiMo source-vs-local-quant proof is blocked by pod occupancy, not by missing source files, fabric, or minimum free memory. Controlled displacement of Qwen TP4 is required before source-vs-quant tool/cache/long/speed probes can run.

## 2026-06-06 - Local vMLX/MLXStudio release blocker ledger re-anchor

- Re-anchored on local vMLX/MLXStudio only; no adlab/Max2/TP4/RDMA/TB work belongs in this lane.
- Added `docs/internal/LOCAL_VMLX_MLXSTUDIO_RELEASE_BLOCKER_LEDGER_2026_06_06.md` and `build/current-local-vmlx-mlxstudio-release-blocker-ledger-20260606.json`.
- Current manifest source: `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-noheavy-pointer-refresh-20260606.json`.
- Current release state remains `status=fail`, `prepackage_ready=false`, `release_ready=false`.
- Explicit release blockers remain MiMo V2.5 JANG_2L runtime quality and MiniMax issue179 reporter/root-cause provenance; installed/public app audits and live UI/tool/smoke rows are also open/non-pass.

## 2026-06-06 - XML function parser repair for MiMo degraded wrapper shape

- Patched `vmlx_engine/tool_parsers/xml_function_tool_parser.py` to repair a complete MiMo-style `<function=...>` block that dropped only the opening `<tool_call>` wrapper, schema-gated by request tool names.
- Added focused tests in `tests/test_xml_function_tool_parser.py` for repaired allowed function, rejected unknown function, and bare `<tool_call>` fail-closed.
- Verification passed: py_compile, focused parser pytest (`10 passed`), and `run_tool_call_contract.py` (`status=pass`).
- Boundary: this is a local parser robustness fix only; MiMo runtime quality and release clearance remain open.

## 2026-06-06 - Tool contract pointer refreshed to XML-function repair artifact

- Updated release/current-suite/objective proof pointers to `build/current-tool-call-contract-after-xml-function-repair-20260606.json`.
- Focused pointer tests passed (`3 passed`) and py_compile passed.
- Regenerated `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-xml-function-repair-20260606.json`; it remains fail/not release-ready as expected because MiMo runtime quality and MiniMax provenance blockers remain open.

## 2026-06-06 - Live local MiMo tool probe after XML parser repair

- Launched local-only MiMo server on `127.0.0.1:8897` with simple engine, `xml_function`, `think_xml`, thinking disabled, and no KV quantization.
- Probe artifact: `build/current-mimo-live-xml-repair-tool-probe-20260606.json`.
- Result: fail. Auto tool returned punctuation garbage/no tool calls after ~80s; required tool returned HTTP 400 because no tool call was produced; text recovery failed after tool rows.
- Server was stopped and port 8897 is clear.
- Boundary: parser repair is real but MiMo live tool/runtime quality remains open; do not mark MiMo tools release-cleared.

## 2026-06-06 - MiMo auto-tool-enabled live probe still fails baseline text

- Relaunched local-only MiMo with `--enable-auto-tool-choice`; server confirmed `Tool calling: ENABLED (parser: xml_function)`.
- Probe artifact: `build/current-mimo-live-auto-tool-enabled-probe-20260606.json`.
- Result: fail. Baseline `Reply exactly READY.` before any tool call returned `The user said`; auto tool still returned punctuation garbage/no tool calls; post-tool exact text also returned `The user said`.
- Classification strengthened: current MiMo blocker is broader local generation/runtime quality, not just parser strictness or missing auto-tool flag.

## 2026-06-06 - Codex MiMo MLLM interface fix, release still blocked

- Scope stayed local in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no adlab/Max2/TP4/RDMA/TB work.
- Fixed registered MiMo `mlx_vlm` wrapper dropping `inputs_embeds` in `Model.__call__`.
- Added `tests/test_mimo_v2_mllm_runtime_registration.py` proving `inputs_embeds`, `cache`, `mask`, and kwargs are forwarded.
- Regenerated MiMo current audit at `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-current-audit-after-mllm-inputs-embeds-fix-20260606.json`.
- Regenerated release manifest at `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-mimo-mllm-inputs-embeds-fix-20260606.json`; still red: `current_proof_sweep=fail`, `prepackage_ready=false`, `release_ready=false`.
- Remaining MiMo blockers: long prompt, tool protocol, decode speed, source-vs-quant, media wiring.

## 2026-06-06 — Codex: MiMo SimpleEngine thinking-off decode partial fix
- Scope: active Python worktree `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, no adlab, no packaging/signing/release.
- Fixed SimpleEngine MiMo text-only decode policy so effective `enable_thinking=false` suppresses native `<think>` and `</think>` token IDs at logits boundary.
- Focused verification passed: py_compile and `tests/test_mllm_message_serialization.py` MiMo slice (`5 passed, 67 deselected`).
- Live conservative source server row improved short exact output: `ACK-MIMO-742`, no think-tag leak.
- Live rows still red: explicit-system no-think returned empty visible output, no-system sentinel ignored exact instruction, thinking-true explicit-system returned empty visible output. MiMo remains not release-cleared.
- Artifact: `build/current-mimo-simple-thinking-off-decode-fix-live-red-20260606.json`.

## 2026-06-06 — Codex: MiMo SimpleEngine first-token EOS partial fix
- Scope: active Python worktree only; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, no adlab, no packaging/signing/release.
- Added MiMo thinking-off first-token-only EOS suppression in SimpleEngine. This targets the proven `failing_system_long` top-token `<|im_end|>` without suppressing natural EOS after generation begins.
- Focused verification passed: py_compile and MiMo `test_mllm_message_serialization.py` slice (`5 passed, 67 deselected`).
- Live conservative source server now changes first-token-probe shape from empty stop to starting with `ACK`, but still continues with extra text and fails exact output. Sentinel rows still fail instruction following and speed is still far below target.
- Artifact: `build/current-mimo-simple-thinking-off-first-token-eos-live-red-20260606.json`.
- MiMo remains release-red. Do not package, sign, notarize, tag, or call release-ready.

## 2026-06-06 — Codex: MiMo source-vs-quant preflight refreshed
- Scope: active Python worktree only; no source launch, no worker disruption, no release action.
- Refreshed `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-source-vs-quant-first-divergence-20260606.json` with local quant endpoint healthy on `127.0.0.1:8897` under current source and remote Max2 source path present at `/Volumes/EricsLLMDrive/jangq-ai/sources/MiMo-V2.5`.
- Remaining blocker is source endpoint down: `http://erics-m5-max2.local:8126` connection refused. Rows did not execute; status remains `missing_prerequisites` and cannot classify model artifact vs runtime.

## 2026-06-06 — Codex: MiMo batched thinking-off decode policy source fix
- Scope: active Python worktree only; no model release/signing/packaging.
- Threaded effective `enable_thinking` into MLLM scheduler/batch requests and added MiMo-only batched logits policy: suppress `<think>`/`</think>` under thinking-off and suppress `<|im_end|>` only before first generated token.
- Focused verification passed: py_compile and `tests/test_mllm_continuous_batching.py` MiMo sampler slice (`2 passed, 37 deselected`).
- Artifact: `build/current-mimo-batched-thinking-off-decode-policy-source-20260606.json`.
- Boundary: source regression only; live continuous-batching cache/L2, tools, speed, source-vs-quant, and media rows remain red.

## 2026-06-06 — Codex: Qwen MTP gdn_sink source proof and local guardrail refresh

- Scope: Python engine/MLXStudio release lane only in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no ADLab/TB/RDMA/Swift/deprecated wrapper work.
- Verified current source already contains Qwen GatedDelta MTP `gdn_sink` fix at `525ccedf`.
- Focused proof passed: py_compile for Qwen MTP patch/test files and pytest filter for dense `gdn_sink` propagation plus VL Qwen3.5/3.6 pre-load activation (`3 passed, 587 deselected`).
- Added proof artifact `build/current-qwen36-mtp-gdn-sink-source-proof-20260606.json` and ledger entries classifying this as runtime source fixed but not packaged/release-proven.
- Updated local AGENTS.md with model-family/cache/VL/release guardrails; this AGENTS change remains local-only and must not be committed under Eric's instruction.

## 2026-06-07 - Qwen27 MXFP4-MTP deterministic Responses cancel/recovery proof

- Scope stayed in active Python worktree `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated wrapper, ADLab, TB/RDMA, Swift, package, signing, notarization, tag, or release action.
- Patched `tests/cross_matrix/run_issue179_responses_cancel_probe.py` to expose parser/sampling knobs while preserving MiniMax issue #179 defaults.
- Focused no-heavy validation passed: py_compile clean; `tests/test_issue179_responses_cancel_probe.py` -> 11 passed.
- Live artifact: `build/current-qwen27-mxfp4-mtp-responses-cancel-mtp-deterministic-20260607.json`.
- Result: pass. Request used `/v1/responses` streaming with `temperature=0.0`, `top_p=1.0`, `top_k=0`, `--tool-call-parser qwen`, `--reasoning-parser qwen3`; cancel returned HTTP 200 for `resp_76a19f72835c`.
- Server log confirms native MTP `READY D2` and `MLLM native MTP path activated ... depth=2`; no `gdn_sink` TypeError or stream generator error.
- Matrix impact: Qwen27 MXFP4-MTP deterministic cancel/recovery row is closed; Qwen27 remains partial for real Electron UI, largest-context cache, MXFP8 deterministic policy/session, TP4 route rank/speed, and full media/UI release rows.

## 2026-06-07 - Qwen35 MXFP8-MTP long Responses/tool/cache diagnostic

- Scope stayed in active Python worktree `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no wrapper/Swift/ADLab/package/sign/release action.
- Added deterministic sampling knobs to `tests/cross_matrix/run_responses_long_tool_cache_gate.py` so Qwen native-MTP rows can pass `temperature=0`, `top_p=1`, `top_k=0`, `repetition_penalty=1` instead of silently skipping MTP.
- Focused no-heavy validation passed: py_compile clean; `tests/test_engine_audit.py -k responses_long_context_tool_cache_gate` -> 19 passed, 504 deselected.
- Stochastic artifact `build/current-qwen35-mxfp8-mtp-responses-long-tool-cache-20260607` is red: cache hits observed on turns 2/3, required tools produced calls, no tool markup leak or loops, but native MTP skipped because sampling resolved to temperature=1.0/top_k=20; strict tool evidence also failed.
- Deterministic artifact `build/current-qwen35-mxfp8-mtp-responses-long-tool-cache-deterministic-20260607` is red: native MTP activated at D3, accepted 97/189 drafted tokens, block disk and SSM L2 active, but `/v1/responses` returned HTTP 400 because `tool_choice=required` produced no tool calls.
- Classification: Qwen35 native MTP/cache activation is real, but deterministic MTP plus required-tool behavior is not release-cleared. Do not use stochastic cache hits as MTP proof or deterministic MTP activation as tool proof.

## 2026-06-07 - Codex MiMo current normal-engine proof correction

- Scope stayed in active Python worktree `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated wrapper, Swift, ADLab, TB/RDMA, package, signing, notarization, tag, or release action.
- Inspected current MiMo normal-engine artifact `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-mimo-v25-jang2l-tools-nomedia-refresh-after-qwen35-20260607/JANGQ_MiMo-V2.5-JANG_2L/result.json` and server log.
- Current positives: text `ACK`, repeat cache hit `cached_tokens=67` / `cache_detail=paged`, block-disk L2 wrote 4 blocks / 141 tokens, multiturn `blue cat`, native cache `mimo_v2` / `mixed_swa_kv_v1` / `mimo_v2_asymmetric_swa`.
- Current blocker: `tool_choice=required` returns HTTP 400 after 96 generated tokens, no parsed `tool_calls`, raw preview starts `<tool_call>` plus punctuation/fullwidth comma garbage, speed about `1.6 tok/s`.
- Updated runtime matrix, MiMo status, media worklist, cross-model issue register, and local AGENTS to supersede stale claims that current MiMo `record_fact` was parsed.
- Release remains red; no signing/notarization/public update allowed.

## 2026-06-07 — Codex: MiMo tight-memory + mixed-SWA MLLM cache fix
- Scope: active Python engine worktree `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, no ADLab/TB/RDMA implementation work, no signing/notarization/release.
- Fixed MiMo MLLM tight-memory lifecycle by draining MLX allocator state around prefills when Metal working-set headroom is tight.
- Fixed MiMo MLLM long-prefix cache by detecting live `RotatingKVCache` in extracted cache objects and routing through clean mixed-SWA prompt-boundary store when wrappers hide metadata.
- Live proof: `build/current-local-long-context-cache-mimo-v25-installed-64w-after-tight-memory-rotating-store-20260607` passed with `cached_tokens=435`, `cache_detail=paged`, 7 block-disk writes, `LONGCTX-OK`, and no Metal OOM/server disconnect.
- Remaining red: speed, full tool-result/multiturn tool matrix, VL/audio/video, UI/installed-app parity, release packaging.

## 2026-06-06 21:29 local - MiMo tight-memory tool prefill OOM fixed in source gate

- Patched text-only MLLM tight-memory prefill to chunk shorter fallback-tool-schema prompts instead of using one-shot language-model prefill under low Metal working-set margin.
- Focused compile/unit checks passed: `py_compile` for `vmlx_engine/mllm_batch_generator.py` and `tests/test_mllm_scheduler_cache.py`; 3 focused scheduler/cache tests passed.
- Live MiMo no-media source gate passed: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-mimo-v25-jang2l-tools-nomedia-after-tight-tool-prefill-chunk-20260607/summary.json` reported `status=pass`, `failed=0`.
- Required-tool row returned real `record_fact({"value":"blue-cat"})`; prior native Metal OOM did not recur.
- Still red for release: MiMo speed around 1-2 tok/s, reasoning quality poor, media/VL/audio/video unwired, UI/installed-app/tool-continuation matrix incomplete.

## 2026-06-06 21:36 local - MiMo tool-result continuation gate added and fixed

- Extended `bench/all_local_model_smoke.py --include-tools` with `tool_result_continuation`: assistant tool-call history + role=tool result + exact final answer, rejecting second tool calls and raw tool markup.
- First expanded MiMo gate failed before generation with template 500: `TypeError: Can only get item pairs from a mapping.` Artifact: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-mimo-v25-jang2l-tools-continuation-nomedia-20260607/`.
- Fixed MiMo text-only MLLM template path to normalize OpenAI string `function.arguments` to mapping copies before Jinja rendering.
- Post-fix expanded MiMo gate passed: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-mimo-v25-jang2l-tools-continuation-after-template-args-fix-20260607/`, `status=pass`, `failed=0`.
- Tool continuation proof: visible `STORED blue-cat`, no tool calls, no raw markup; required-tool row still returns `record_fact({"value":"blue-cat"})`.
- Still release red: speed about 1.76 tok/s, reasoning quality poor, media/VL/audio/video unwired, UI/installed-app broader API matrix incomplete.

## 2026-06-06 21:41 local - MiMo strict JSON and exact code rows added

- Extended `bench/all_local_model_smoke.py` with always-on `structured_json_exact` and `exact_code_whitespace` probes.
- Live MiMo no-media source gate passed with tools + JSON + code rows: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-mimo-v25-jang2l-json-code-tools-nomedia-20260607/`, `status=pass`, `failed=0`.
- JSON row produced exactly `{\"status\":\"ok\",\"value\":\"blue-cat\",\"count\":3}` and parsed equal to expected object.
- Code row produced exactly `def add(a, b):\n    return a + b\nprint(add(2, 3))` with indentation/newlines preserved.
- Cache proof remained present: paged cache hit `cached_tokens=67`, block L2 wrote 16 blocks / 797 tokens.
- Still release red: MiMo speed about 1.76 tok/s, reasoning quality poor, media/VL/audio/video unwired, UI/app/API parity incomplete.

## 2026-06-06 21:47 local - LFM expanded structured-output gate red

- Ran expanded no-media source gate on installed LFM2.5 variants: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-lfm25-installed-json-code-tools-nomedia-20260607/`, `status=fail`, `failed=3`.
- All three LFM variants passed required tool and tool-result continuation.
- JANG_2L failed strict JSON because it wrapped the correct object in markdown fences, and failed exact code as `def add(a, b:`.
- MXFP4 and MXFP8 passed strict JSON but failed exact code as `print(add(2, 3)` missing the final `)`.
- Exact-code failures ended with `finish_reason=stop`, not `length`, so not a max-token false positive.
- Classification: LFM structured-output/code exactness remains release-red; do not silently repair code output as a release fix.

## 2026-06-06 21:49 local - Step 3.7 expanded no-media structured-output gate pass

- Correct installed model path is `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/Step-3.7-Flash-JANG_2L`; older CRACK suffix filter returned zero rows.
- Ran expanded no-media source gate: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-step37-jang2l-json-code-tools-nomedia-20260607/`, `status=pass`, `failed=0`.
- Passed text cache repeat with paged hit `cached_tokens=61`, multiturn recall, reasoning-on, required tool, tool-result continuation, strict JSON, and exact code/whitespace.
- Tool required returned real `record_fact({"value":"blue-cat"})`; tool-result continuation returned exact `STORED blue-cat` with no second tool call.
- Native cache reported `step3p7` / `mixed_swa_kv_v1` / `step3p7_full_sliding_kv`; block L2 wrote 10 blocks / 472 tokens.
- Still release red: text/no-media only, no real Step VLM proof, MTP metadata inconsistent (config expects nextn layers but no mtp tensors), API/UI/restart-L2/loop-stop/public parity incomplete.

## 2026-06-06 21:57 local - Gemma4 12B expanded no-media structured-output gates mixed/red

- Gemma4 12B bundles are under `/Users/eric/models`, not `~/.mlxstudio/models`.
- Ran JANG_4M gate: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-12b-jang4m-json-code-tools-nomedia-20260607/`, `status=fail`, `failed=1`.
- Ran MXFP4/MXFP8 gate with candidates skipped: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-12b-mxfp-json-code-tools-nomedia-20260607/`, `status=fail`, `failed=2`.
- Positives: all three pass required tool and tool-result continuation; all report paged+mixed-SWA cache hit `cached_tokens=56` and block L2 writes 9 blocks / 402 tokens.
- Speeds: JANG_4M about 49.4 tok/s, MXFP4 about 59.9 tok/s, MXFP8 about 39.1 tok/s aggregate generation in these no-media rows.
- Failures: all three insert a leading space before `print(add(2, 3))` in exact code; MXFP4/MXFP8 also produce JSON value `" blue-cat"`; MXFP4 exact ACK cache rows echo the prefix instead of ACK.
- Classification: Gemma4 tools/cache/speed evidence is useful, but structured-output exactness remains red; no media/UI/API/release claim.

## 2026-06-07 local - Qwen3.6 MTP expanded no-media structured-output gate

- Scope stayed in active Python engine worktree `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, no Swift, no ADLab/TB/RDMA implementation work, no package/sign/notarize/tag/release action.
- Ran expanded no-media source gate:
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-qwen36-mtp-json-code-tools-nomedia-20260607/`, overall `status=fail`, `failed=1`.
- `Qwen3.6-27B-MXFP4-MTP` passed text cache, paged+SSM hit `cached_tokens=56`, multiturn recall, reasoning-on, required tool, tool-result continuation, strict JSON, and exact code/whitespace.
- `Qwen3.6-27B-MXFP8-MTP` passed the same rows with paged+SSM hit `cached_tokens=56`.
- `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-MXFP8-MTP` passed text cache, multiturn recall, required tool, tool-result continuation, strict JSON, and exact code/whitespace, but failed `reasoning_on`: HTTP 200, hidden reasoning present, visible content empty, request-level `reasoning_chars=986`, `completion_tokens=256`, server `finish=length`.
- Runtime evidence: 27B MXFP4 native MTP `READY D2`; 27B MXFP8 and 35B MXFP8 native MTP `READY D3`; all three used hybrid attention-KV q4 plus native SSM/GatedDelta companion state, paged cache, block L2, and SSM companion L2.
- No `gdn_sink` TypeError, stream crash, raw XML tool leak, required-tool failure, strict JSON failure, or exact-code failure occurred in this Qwen gate.
- Classification: Qwen27 MXFP4/MXFP8 MTP are source no-media tool/structured/cache green but release-partial; Qwen35 MXFP8 MTP remains red for thinking-mode visible-finalization under native MTP/MoE plus missing UI/API/media/restart/largest-context rows. Do not disable thinking as a fake release fix.

## 2026-06-07 local - Qwen35 MoE MTP reasoning probe budget corrected

- Scope stayed in active Python engine worktree; no package/sign/notarize/tag/release action.
- Added Qwen3.6 MoE MTP to the same 512-token reasoning probe budget class already used for ZAYA/Nemotron. This is a harness budget correction, not a runtime/parser fallback.
- Focused validation passed:
  `.venv/bin/python -B -m py_compile bench/all_local_model_smoke.py tests/test_all_local_model_smoke.py`
  and
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_all_local_model_smoke.py -k 'reasoning_probe_gets_budget_for_visible_final_answer'`
  -> `3 passed`.
- Live Qwen35 follow-up passed:
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-qwen36-35b-mxfp8-mtp-json-code-tools-nomedia-after-reasoning-budget-20260607/`, `status=pass`, `failed=0`.
- Reasoning row changed from empty-visible at 256 tokens to visible `FINAL=OK` at 512-token budget, with `reasoning_chars=1038`, `completion_tokens=274`, native MTP D3, and no validation failures.
- Other Qwen35 rows in the follow-up passed: text cache `ACK`, paged+SSM hit `cached_tokens=56`, multiturn `blue cat`, required tool `record_fact({"value":"blue-cat"})`, tool-result continuation `STORED blue-cat`, strict JSON, exact code/whitespace, block L2 and SSM companion L2.
- Classification updated: Qwen35 no-media source gate is green after budget correction, but release remains partial for UI/API/media/restart-L2/largest-context/installed-app parity and explicit max-output-token UX behavior.

## 2026-06-07 local - Qwen27 JANG_4M-MTP expanded no-media parity gate

- Scope stayed in active Python engine worktree; no deprecated wrapper, Swift, ADLab/TB/RDMA work, package, signing, notarization, tag, upload, or public release action.
- Ran expanded no-media source gate:
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-qwen36-27b-jang4m-mtp-json-code-tools-nomedia-20260607/`, `status=pass`, `failed=0`.
- Rows passed: text cache `ACK`, paged+SSM hit `cached_tokens=56`, multiturn `blue cat`, reasoning-on visible `FINAL=OK` with `reasoning_chars=735`, required tool `record_fact({"value":"blue-cat"})`, tool-result continuation `STORED blue-cat`, strict JSON, exact code/whitespace.
- Runtime evidence: native MTP `READY D3`; Qwen3.6 VL artifact path; hybrid model with 16 attention and 48 SSM layers; q4 attention-KV storage for cache boundaries; SSM/GatedDelta companion state native full precision; block L2 and SSM companion L2 enabled; VLM hybrid cache HIT `(KV+SSM)`.
- No `gdn_sink` TypeError, stream generator crash, raw XML tool leak, required-tool failure, strict JSON failure, or exact-code failure occurred.
- Classification: Qwen27 JANG_4M-MTP is now no-media source green for structured output/tools/native-MTP/cache alongside MXFP4/MXFP8. Qwen27 remains release-partial for installed-app/UI/media/restart-L2/largest-context/cancel-timeout/TP4/API parity.

## 2026-06-07 local - Qwen27 JANG_4M-MTP restart/L2 restore gate

- Scope stayed in active Python engine worktree; no package/sign/notarize/tag/upload/release action.
- Ran restart/L2 source gate:
  `build/current-local-restart-l2-qwen36-27b-jang4m-mtp-20260607/`, model `Qwen3.6-27B-JANG_4M-MTP`, `status=pass`.
- First process returned exact `ACK`, wrote block L2 (`disk_writes=1`, `total_tokens_on_disk=27`) and SSM companion L2 (`stores=1`, `total_tokens_on_disk=27`).
- Second process restarted against the same shared block cache and returned exact `ACK` with API usage `cached_tokens=27`, `cache_detail=paged+ssm+disk`.
- Cache stats after restart: block disk `disk_hits=1`; SSM companion disk `hits=1`; scheduler `last_cache_execution` had `disk_hit=true`, `reconstructed=true`, `reconstruction_ok=true`, `dequantized=true`, and `dequantization_ok=true`.
- Runtime evidence: native MTP `READY D3`; hybrid model with 16 attention and 48 SSM layers; q4 attention-KV storage boundaries; SSM disk HIT; VLM hybrid cache HIT `(KV+SSM)`; clean SSM re-derive after restore.
- Classification: Qwen27 JANG_4M-MTP restart/L2 restore is source-green for typed hybrid SSM cache. Qwen27 remains release-partial for installed-app UI, media, largest-context, cancellation/timeout cleanup, TP4 route rank/speed, API parity, packaging, signing, notarization, and public download updates.

## 2026-06-07 local - Qwen27 JANG_4M-MTP long-context cache gate

- Scope stayed in active Python engine worktree; no package/sign/notarize/tag/upload/release action.
- 2,048-word gate artifact:
  `build/current-local-long-context-cache-qwen36-27b-jang4m-mtp-2048w-20260607/`, `status=fail`, both turns HTTP 413 `prompt_too_long`, prompt about 8,918 tokens against explicit 8,192 cap.
- 1,800-word gate artifact:
  `build/current-local-long-context-cache-qwen36-27b-jang4m-mtp-1800w-20260607/`, `status=fail`, both turns HTTP 413 `prompt_too_long`, VLM text prompt about 10,843 tokens against explicit 8,192 cap.
- 1,200-word gate artifact:
  `build/current-local-long-context-cache-qwen36-27b-jang4m-mtp-1200w-20260607/`, `status=pass`.
- Passing 1,200-word row: first and second turns returned exact `LONGCTX-OK`; prompt tokens `7236`; second turn `cached_tokens=7235`, `cache_detail=paged+ssm`; output status pass.
- Cache/runtime evidence: native MTP `READY D3`; q4 KV quant round-trip passed; 16 attention layers use `TurboQuantKVCache`; 48 SSM companion layers remain native; first turn wrote 114 block L2 blocks; cache totals included `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=7235` and `l2_ssm_tokens_on_disk=14467`; second turn VLM hybrid cache HIT `(KV+SSM)`, re-compressed 16 KV layers to TurboQuant, and clean SSM re-derive stored companion state.
- Scheduler evidence: `last_cache_execution.cached_tokens=7235`, `dequantized=true`, `dequantization_ok=true`, `reconstructed=true`, `reconstruction_ok=true`.
- Classification: Qwen27 JANG_4M-MTP is source-green for a 7,236-token long-prefix cache reuse near the explicit 8k cap. Still release-partial for UI max-context/settings behavior, contexts above 8k if required, installed-app parity, media, API parity, cancellation/timeout cleanup, packaging, signing, notarization, and public download updates.

## 2026-06-07 local - Max output/context UI/API contract after Qwen long-context boundary

- Scope stayed in active Python engine/panel worktree; no package/sign/notarize/tag/upload/release action.
- Ran:
  `.venv/bin/python -B -s tests/cross_matrix/run_max_output_context_contract.py --out build/current-max-output-context-contract-after-qwen27-long-context-20260607.json`.
- Artifact:
  `build/current-max-output-context-contract-after-qwen27-long-context-20260607.json`, `status=pass`, `failed=[]`, `missing_markers=[]`.
- Coverage counts: engine/API `26 passed`; panel/settings/request-builder `54 passed`, `334 skipped` by vitest filter.
- Contract coverage includes: startup `--max-tokens` is only omitted-request output default; explicit Chat/Responses/Completions/Anthropic/Ollama caps can go below/above startup default without mutating prompt context; prompt/context aliases clamp context without rewriting output caps; panel separates Max Output Tokens from Max Context Tokens; explicit max context emits max prompt/context CLI flag; per-chat `maxTokens` is request-scoped; stale legacy `32768` session output caps are migrated; `maxThinkingTokens` is template thinking budget only.
- Classification: source and panel unit wiring for max-output/max-context boundary is green after Qwen long-context proof. Still release-partial until live installed-app UI/session proves actual selected max context/max output launches expected args and matches `/health`, request, and cache telemetry.

## 2026-06-07 local - Qwen27 JANG_4M-MTP installed-app UI max-context proof

- Scope stayed in active Python engine/panel worktree; no deprecated wrapper, Swift, ADLab/TB/RDMA work, package, signing, notarization, tag, upload, appcast, or public release action.
- Patched `panel/scripts/live-real-ui-model-proof.mjs` so the real UI proof can pass explicit max prompt/context env into the server command and record it in `requestContract`.
- Added focused manifest tests so success and failure result blocks both record `requestMaxPromptTokens`.
- Focused validation already passed:
  `node --check panel/scripts/live-real-ui-model-proof.mjs`,
  `.venv/bin/python -B -m py_compile tests/test_release_regression_manifest.py`,
  and
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_release_regression_manifest.py -k 'real_ui_script_records_request_contract'`
  -> `2 passed`.
- Ran installed-app UI proof with `/Applications/vMLX.app` and installed bundled Python:
  `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-installed-app-qwen36-27b-jang4m-mtp-maxcontext-20260607-proof.json`,
  `status=pass`.
- Server command included `--max-tokens 128`, `--max-prompt-tokens 8192`, paged cache, block disk L2, and `--is-mllm`.
- Proof recorded `requestMaxTokens=128`, `requestMaxPromptTokens=8192`, and `/health.max_prompt_tokens=8192`.
- Proven surfaces included installed app UI, settings persistence, server cache controls, chat completions, cache endpoint stats, cache hit telemetry, L2 disk storage, native cache status, real loaded model, and generation defaults.
- Second UI turn reported `cachedTokens=18`, `cacheDetail=paged+ssm`; cache stats after the run showed block disk L2 writes/hits and SSM companion disk stores.
- Native cache health reported Qwen3.6 hybrid SSM typed cache with TurboQuant attention-KV storage only on attention layers, native companion state for SSM layers, prefix/paged cache, and block disk L2.
- MTP health reported native runtime active D3, text+VL scope, and artifact tensors present. UI chat requests used non-deterministic default sampling, so native MTP was available but request-policy-skipped for those exact requests.
- Classification: this narrows the Qwen27 installed-app max-output/max-context blocker, but it is not release clearance. Normal local-session installed-app launch/settings, media/VL/audio/video, broader API parity, cancellation/recovery, speed, signing/notarization, and public download updates remain blocked.

## 2026-06-07 local - MiMo decode speed gate row and PP OOM proof

- Scope stayed in active Python engine worktree; no deprecated wrapper, Swift, ADLab/TB/RDMA work, package, signing, notarization, tag, upload, appcast, or public release action.
- Added `mimo_v25_jang2l` to `tests/cross_matrix/run_decode_speed_gate.py` using the normal local artifact `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/MiMo-V2.5-JANG_2L`.
- MiMo speed row uses MLLM mode, `xml_function` tool parser, `think_xml` reasoning parser, paged cache, block disk L2, q4 storage-boundary KV, `expected_min_tps=40.0`, reduced PP targets, and `--completion-batch-size 64`.
- Updated the speed harness so error artifacts preserve partial live evidence instead of losing warm/coherency/health data when a later request kills the server.
- Focused validation passed:
  `.venv/bin/python -B -m py_compile tests/cross_matrix/run_decode_speed_gate.py tests/test_current_regression_suite.py`
  and
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_current_regression_suite.py -k 'decode_speed_gate'`
  -> `3 passed`.
- Live MiMo artifact:
  `build/current-decode-speed-live-mimo-v25-jang2l-source-partial-evidence-20260607.json`.
- Live result: `status=error`, server disconnected after Metal OOM during first PP request.
- Partial evidence preserved: warm row completed at about `0.2 tok/s`; deterministic coherency row returned exact `READY\n17+28=45\nCERULEAN` at `1.58 tok/s`.
- `/health` before crash reported MiMo native cache `mixed_swa_kv_v1`, q4 storage-boundary KV, prefix cache, paged cache, block disk L2, and generic flat TurboQuant KV disabled.
- Classification: MiMo remains release-red for speed and PP/largest-context cache. This is not a model replacement proof and not a release clearance.

## 2026-06-07 local - Media empty-warning rollback for VLM guard failures

- Scope stayed in active Python engine/panel worktree; no deprecated wrapper, Swift, ADLab/TB/RDMA work, package, signing, notarization, tag, upload, appcast, or public release action.
- Patched `panel/src/main/ipc/chat.ts` normal completion path so media requests that finish with response warnings but no visible content, no reasoning, and no tool activity delete the just-added media user message.
- This covers the non-throw path for VLM image prefill guard failures where the UI previously could persist a failed image turn and replay it into the next text-only prompt.
- The path logs `rolled_back_empty_warning_media_user_message` and throws `Media request failed before visible output: ...` so the renderer reloads clean DB state and shows an actionable failure.
- Existing thrown-error media rollback remains unchanged for crash/disconnect paths.
- Focused validation:
  `cd panel && npm test -- --run tests/media-rollback-source.test.ts`
  -> `2 passed`.
- Responses warning regression:
  `cd panel && npm test -- --run tests/responses-warnings.test.ts`
  -> `19 passed`.
- Classification: this fixes UI/history recovery after media guard failures. It does not clear full VL/audio/video support for Gemma4, MiMo, Step3.7, Nemo Omni, or any other family.

## 2026-06-07 local - Structured-output repair warning surfaced

- Scope stayed in active Python engine worktree; no deprecated wrapper, Swift, ADLab/TB/RDMA work, package, signing, notarization, tag, upload, appcast, or public release action.
- Patched `vmlx_engine/server.py` so Chat Completions and Responses non-streaming paths add a `warnings` entry when JSON was repaired or schema-coerced after generation.
- Returned content remains the repaired canonical JSON when repair succeeds, but clients and benchmark/catalog pipelines can now tell raw model JSON from post-generation repair.
- Warning text explicitly says the behavior is post-generation repair, not guided or constrained decoding.
- Focused validation:
  `.venv/bin/python -B -m py_compile vmlx_engine/server.py tests/test_structured_output.py`
  and
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_structured_output.py -k 'repair or structured or chat_completion_repairs'`
  -> `43 passed, 2 skipped`.
- Classification: this improves structured-output diagnostics and scoring integrity. It does not clear exact code/whitespace failures, raw JSON drift, or hard constrained decoding for LFM, Gemma4, MiMo, Step, or other model families.

## 2026-06-07 local - Deterministic sampling filters no longer inherit bundle top-p/top-k

- Scope stayed in active Python engine worktree; no deprecated wrapper, Swift, ADLab/TB/RDMA work, package, signing, notarization, tag, upload, appcast, or public release action.
- Found a runtime kwargs-resolution ambiguity behind the Gemma4 exact-output investigation: effective `temperature=0` requests could still inherit bundle `top_p/top_k` defaults such as Gemma4 `top_p=0.95` and `top_k=64`.
- Patched `vmlx_engine/server.py` with `_normalize_deterministic_sampling_filters()` and wired it at every `_set_resolved_top_k()` route assembly site. Greedy requests now forward `top_p=1.0` and omit `top_k` when those filters were not explicitly requested and no explicit server default exists.
- Explicit request filters and explicit server defaults are preserved; this is not a hidden forced sampling policy for stochastic requests.
- Added route/source tests in `tests/test_engine_audit.py` for the bundle-default reproduction, route-site coverage, and explicit-filter preservation.
- Focused validation:
  `.venv/bin/python -B -m py_compile vmlx_engine/server.py tests/test_engine_audit.py`
  and
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_engine_audit.py -k 'deterministic_filters or temperature_zero_omits or temperature_zero_preserves or log_and_forward_supported_sampling_kwargs'`
  -> `4 passed`.
- Classification: real runtime-default fix. It improves deterministic exact-output proof hygiene, but LFM/Gemma4 remain release-red until their raw JSON/code gates are rerun and pass under the patched route.

## 2026-06-07 local - LFM/Gemma exact-output rerun after deterministic sampling fix

- Reran LFM2.5 installed no-media JSON/code/tools gate after `74a213b8`:
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-lfm25-installed-json-code-tools-nomedia-after-deterministic-sampling-20260607/summary.json`
  -> `status=fail`, `completed=3`, `failed=3`.
- LFM residuals after the runtime-default fix: JANG_2L still wraps the correct JSON object in markdown fences and emits `def add(a, b:`; MXFP4/MXFP8 still emit `print(add(2, 3)` without the final closing parenthesis.
- Reran Gemma4 12B no-media JSON/code/tools gate after `74a213b8`:
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-12b-json-code-tools-nomedia-after-deterministic-sampling-20260607/summary.json`
  -> `status=fail`, `completed=3`, `failed=3`.
- Gemma residuals after the runtime-default fix: JANG_4M still inserts one leading space before `print(add(2, 3))`; MXFP4 still echoes the cache prefix instead of exact `ACK`, returns JSON value `" blue-cat"`, and inserts the leading code space; MXFP8 still returns JSON value `" blue-cat"` and inserts the leading code space.
- Classification: inherited bundle `top_p/top_k` on greedy requests was a runtime bug and is fixed/pushed. The remaining LFM/Gemma exact-output failures reproduce after that fix, so they stay release-red as model/template/decode-quality blockers unless a narrower runtime decoder/template cause is proven.

## 2026-06-07 local - MiMo source runtime cache/OOM fixes and remaining speed blocker

- Scope stayed in active Python engine worktree `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, Swift, ADLab/TB/RDMA, package, signing, notarization, tag, upload, appcast, or public release action.
- Fixed source MLLM MiMo load path so generic TurboQuant KV is skipped at the MLLM call site for MiMo-V2. Earlier lower-level tokenizer guards did not affect the packaged MLLM load path.
- Added `_is_mimo_v2_runtime_object_or_name()` in `vmlx_engine/models/mllm.py` and tests proving MiMo loaded-object detection and non-MiMo negative behavior.
- Fixed MiMo runtime quantization traversal: `jang_tools.mimo_v2` stores decoder layers in a normal Python list, so root-level `nn.quantize()` only saw `lm_head`. Added `_quantize_mimo_v2_runtime_modules()` to walk `model.layers[N]` explicitly and prefix paths as `model.layers.N...`.
- Added regression proof that list-held MiMo decoder layers become `QuantizedLinear` / `QuantizedSwitchLinear` modules.
- Fixed tight-memory MiMo text prefill: short prompts stay one-shot for exactness, but tight-memory text prompts longer than the reduced chunk size fall through to the existing chunked text prefill path. This avoids one-shot Metal OOM on 512/1024-token PP rows.
- Updated decode-speed gate cache-health policy so `mimo_v2_asymmetric_swa` accepts native `mixed_swa_kv` with generic TurboQuant KV disabled.
- Focused validation passed:
  `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile vmlx_engine/models/mllm.py vmlx_engine/mllm_batch_generator.py tests/cross_matrix/run_decode_speed_gate.py tests/test_engine_audit.py tests/test_cross_matrix_audit_runner.py`
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_engine_audit.py -k 'mimo_v2_cached_text_fast_path_uses_absolute_positions or mllm_mimo_v2_quantizes_python_list_decoder_layers or mllm_mimo_v2_turboquant_skip or mllm_mimo_v2_compiled_router'` -> `5 passed`
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_cross_matrix_audit_runner.py -k 'decode_speed_gate'` -> `3 passed`
- Source live artifact after MLLM TQ skip:
  `build/current-decode-speed-live-mimo-v25-jang2l-source-after-mllm-callsite-tq-skip-20260607.json`.
  Result still `status=error`, but health proved generic `turboquant_kv_cache.enabled=false`, native cache `mixed_swa_kv_v1`, exact coherency `READY\n17+28=45\nCERULEAN`, and remaining crash was Metal OOM on PP.
- Source live artifact after manual layer quantization:
  `build/current-decode-speed-live-mimo-v25-jang2l-source-after-manual-layer-quant-20260607.json`.
  Server log proved `MiMo-V2 load quantized 192 runtime modules`; speed remained about `1.6 tok/s`; PP still OOM before the prefill chunking patch.
- Source live artifact after tight-memory chunked prefill:
  `build/current-decode-speed-live-mimo-v25-jang2l-source-after-tight-prefill-chunk-20260607.json`.
  Result moved from crash to `review`; PP completed at `75.79` and `103.49` tok/s; exact coherency survived; decode remained about `1.61 tok/s`.
- No-continuous-batching A/B artifact:
  `build/current-decode-speed-live-mimo-v25-jang2l-source-no-continuous-after-tight-prefill-20260607.json`.
  PP improved to `106.35` and `171.98` tok/s, but decode stayed about `1.63 tok/s`, so decode bottleneck is not primarily continuous-batching overhead.
- Clean source live artifact after cache-policy fix:
  `build/current-decode-speed-live-mimo-v25-jang2l-source-after-cache-policy-fix-20260607.json`.
  Result `status=review` with only real performance notes: `PP below expected 400.00: 76.39, 104.60` and `bundle decode 1.63 < expected 40.00`.
- Classification: source runtime now fixes MiMo generic TQ cache flattening and PP Metal OOM for 512/1024-token text PP rows. MiMo remains release-red because decode speed is still about `1.6 tok/s` versus the `40 tok/s` target, PP is below target, VL/audio/video are still not wired, and installed/release app bundles remain stale until rebuilt and tested.

## 2026-06-07 local - MiniMax current-source cancel proof tracked in manifest

- Scope stayed in active Python engine worktree `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated wrapper, Swift, ADLab/TB/RDMA, package, signing, notarization, tag, upload, appcast, or public release action.
- Committed and pushed `ec8b47f1` (`Track MiniMax local cancel proof in manifest`) to `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- `release_regression_manifest.py` now preserves and validates `local_responses_cancel_probe` inside `.current_proof_sweep.issue179_minimax_k_root_cause_audit`.
- Required proof fields: artifact exists, status pass, response id seen, cancel HTTP 200, cancel route present, and no bad text captured.
- Focused validation passed: `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile tests/cross_matrix/release_regression_manifest.py tests/test_release_regression_manifest.py` plus pytest issue179/MiniMax manifest slice -> `50 passed, 288 deselected`.
- Regenerated local no-heavy manifest at `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-minimax-cancel-field-20260607.json`; it exposes local cancel proof as green but still reports `prepackage_ready=false` and `release_ready=false`.
- Classification: current-source MiniMax cancel route is not the active blocker. Reporter parity/provenance/root-cause evidence remains open, so no release/sign/notarize/public-download action is allowed.

## 2026-06-07 local - MiMo async decode bottleneck exposed in proof sweep

- Scope stayed in active Python engine worktree `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated wrapper, Swift, ADLab/TB/RDMA, package, signing, notarization, tag, upload, appcast, or public release action.
- Updated local-only `AGENTS.md` with a front-loaded release control board covering MiMo, Qwen 27/35 MTP, Nemotron/Nemo Omni, LFM, MiniMax, DSV4, Step 3.7, Gemma4, ZAYA/hybrid/SSM, APIs, tools, cache, media, UI, and release rows. This file remains local-only and uncommitted.
- Committed and pushed `8212ba7c` (`Expose MiMo async decode bottleneck`) to `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- `run_mimo_v2_jang2l_current_audit.py` now parses the decode-speed log for MiMo SwitchGLU fast-path counters and `VMLINUX_DECODE_TRACE_NEXT` async/total/step/materialize timings.
- Current proof artifact: `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-current-audit-after-fastpath-async-bottleneck-20260607.json`.
- Current evidence: bundle decode `1.7918 tok/s`, greedy decode `1.8323 tok/s`, fast path active, max fast-path calls `4096`, max compiled shapes `2`, max async wait `597.49 ms`, classification `switchglu_fastpath_active_but_metal_async_wait_dominates`.
- Release manifest proof sweep now exposes `switchglu_fastpath_active_but_slow=true`, `async_decode_wait_dominates=true`, and the bottleneck classification.
- Focused validation passed: py_compile plus `tests/test_release_regression_manifest.py -k 'mimo_v2_root_cause or mimo_v2_current_audit_extracts_fastpath_async_bottleneck or proof_sweep_includes_mimo'` -> `5 passed, 306 deselected`.
- Full `tests/test_release_regression_manifest.py` remains non-green with 4 stale pointer-contract failures unrelated to this MiMo patch: DSV4 proof freshness missing the 2026-06-07 preflight in older manifest/suite/objective artifacts, ZAYA-VL artifact expectation drift, current regression suite pointer expectation drift, and run_release_regression_manifest DEFAULT_OUT expectation drift.
- Classification: MiMo speed is still release-red. Active fast path is not enough; Metal async wait dominates. Next runtime work should profile/fuse the actual affine/JANG routed-expert or attention/decode kernel path, while bundle-side requant should only be used to eliminate metadata/sidecar uncertainty.

2026-06-07 MiMo JANGTQ2 source-runtime update:
- Copied promoted /Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/MiMo-V2.5-JANGTQ_2 from erics-m5-max2.local and deleted known bad local MiMo JANG_2L/stale cache paths.
- JANG tools main d67d753 accepts prestacked MiMo JANGTQ bundles in verify_bundle with synthetic metadata-truth test.
- vMLX codex/pr-intake-manifest c2a0b3c8 points MiMo gates at MiMo-V2.5-JANGTQ_2.
- vMLX codex/pr-intake-manifest edb0581c binds prestacked MiMo JANGTQ tensors in the MLLM runtime and adds a MiMo TurboQuant SwitchGLU decode fast path.
- Source live proof: build/current-decode-speed-live-mimo-v25-jangtq2-source-after-tq-decode-fastpath-20260607.json status=review, coherent READY/math/color and count outputs, bundle decode=38.94 tok/s, greedy=39.93 tok/s, server log shows MiMo-V2 TurboQuant SwitchGLU decode fast path active calls=4096.
- Remaining blockers: packaged vMLX.app bundled Python still old and fails MiMo JANGTQ2 startup; PP remains ~145 tok/s below current 400 gate; broader UI/cache/tool/VL/audio/video release matrix not rerun. Do not tag/sign/notarize/release from this source proof alone.

2026-06-07 MiMo JANGTQ2 packaged-runtime refresh:
- Locally refreshed staged `panel/release/mac-arm64/vMLX.app` bundled `site-packages/vmlx_engine/models/mllm.py` from source commit edb0581c and removed bundled vmlx_engine pyc/cache files. This is a local staged-app refresh, not a signed/notarized release rebuild.
- Packaged gate artifact: `build/current-decode-speed-live-mimo-v25-jangtq2-packaged-after-bundled-refresh-20260607.json`.
- Result: `status=review`, but startup blocker is fixed and decode speed clears floor: bundle `40.1556 tok/s`, greedy `40.6678 tok/s`.
- Server log proves `MiMo-V2 TurboQuant SwitchGLU decode fast path active: calls=4096 compiled_shapes=1` in bundled Python.
- Health/cache proof: MiMo native `mixed_swa_kv_v1`, q4 storage quantization, prefix=true, paged=true, block_disk_l2=true, generic TurboQuant KV disabled.
- Remaining MiMo blockers: PP `127.76/124.87 tok/s` below 400 target; pp row generated "The user wants me..." instead of exact READY under long prompt; count-row semantic acceptance still needs stronger full-output check; full tool-result/auto-tool/multiturn/adversarial loop-stop/cache-hit-restart/media/UI matrix still open.
- Release boundary: staged app was modified locally and is not a notarized release artifact. No tag/sign/notarize/download update is allowed from this proof alone.

## 2026-06-07 MiMo JANGTQ2 audit pointer refreshed

- Committed and pushed `ea307a21 Refresh MiMo JANGTQ2 audit proof` on `codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- Current promoted local MiMo bundle remains `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/MiMo-V2.5-JANGTQ_2`.
- Generated local size/path manifest `build/current-mimo-jangtq2-local-manifest-20260607.tsv` for the promoted bundle.
- Regenerated `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-current-audit-after-jangtq2-packaged-speed-proof-20260607.json`.
- MiMo audit status remains `open`, but `manifest_integrity=true` and `decode_speed_target=true` after packaged JANGTQ2 proof.
- Remaining MiMo blockers: long-prompt coherence, tool protocol, CB/system-prompt working-set pressure, source-vs-quant first divergence, and unwired VL/audio/video.
- Reran `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-mimo-jangtq2-audit-refresh-20260607.json`: `current_proof_sweep=fail`, `prepackage_ready=false`, `release_ready=false`.
- Do not sign/notarize/tag/release from this state.

## 2026-06-07 MiMo JANGTQ2 source/quant and objective pointer refresh

- Committed and pushed `fabb60b0 Refresh MiMo JANGTQ2 source quant proof pointers` on `codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- Committed and pushed `ec5d0715 Refresh MiMo JANGTQ2 objective digest` on `codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- Current source-vs-quant preflight artifact: `build/current-mimo-v2-jangtq2-source-vs-quant-first-divergence-preflight-20260607.json`.
- Current source-vs-quant preflight status: `missing_prerequisites`; both model paths exist, source endpoint `erics-m5-max2.local:8126` and quant endpoint `127.0.0.1:8897` are down.
- Current MiMo audit artifact: `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-current-audit-after-jangtq2-source-quant-preflight-refresh-20260607.json`.
- Current objective digest artifact: `build/current-objective-proof-after-mimo-jangtq2-source-quant-preflight-refresh-20260607.json`.
- Objective digest now reports MiMo `decode_speed_blocked=false` from the current JANGTQ2 audit, while keeping MiMo open for long-prompt/tool-context quality, tool protocol, CB/system-prompt working-set pressure, source-vs-quant classification, and VL/audio/video wiring.
- Latest release manifests remain red: `current_proof_sweep=fail`, `prepackage_ready=false`, `release_ready=false`.
- No package/sign/notarize/tag/release/download update is allowed from this state.

## 2026-06-07 no-heavy contract refresh after MLLM guard

- Fixed native-MTP unit construction crash in `vmlx_engine/mllm_batch_generator.py`: finish-time tight-memory allocator drain now uses `getattr(self, "_tight_memory_prefill_drain", False)` so `__new__`-constructed MLLM generator tests and equivalent partial construction paths do not raise `AttributeError`.
- Refreshed no-heavy contracts with current source hashes:
  - `build/current-tool-call-contract-after-current-mimo-proof-20260607.json` pass
  - `build/current-max-output-context-contract-after-current-mimo-proof-20260607.json` pass
  - `build/current-cache-architecture-contract-after-current-mimo-proof-20260607.json` pass
  - `build/current-model-family-detection-contract-after-current-mimo-proof-20260607.json` pass
  - `build/current-parser-registry-contract-after-current-mimo-proof-20260607.json` pass
  - `build/current-model-artifact-format-contract-after-current-mimo-proof-20260607.json` pass
  - `build/current-generation-defaults-contract-after-current-mimo-proof-20260607.json` pass
  - `build/current-native-mtp-contract-after-current-mimo-proof-20260607.json` pass
  - `build/current-vl-media-cache-contract-after-current-mimo-proof-20260607.json` pass
  - `build/current-noheavy-api-cache-contract-after-qwen36-bundled-media-pass-20260607.json` pass
- Current objective digest: `build/current-objective-proof-after-dsv4-preflight-refresh-20260607.json`.
- Objective no-heavy rows now pass; remaining objective open rows are live/model/release rows: cross-family live multi-turn smoke, MiMo behavior/media/source-vs-quant, MiniMax #179 reporter/root cause, real Electron UI cross-family matrix, and DSV4 long-output/code/file quality.
- Current release manifest: `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-issue179-public-dmg-provenance-20260607.json`; still `current_proof_sweep=fail`, `prepackage_ready=false`, `release_ready=false`.
- Committed/pushed `e73ab9ae Refresh no-heavy release contracts after MLLM guard` to `codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- No package/sign/notarize/tag/release/download update is allowed from this state.

## 2026-06-07 - Codex current-suite pointer refresh and release blocker boundary

- Pushed `b83381bc` to `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`: refreshed current suite/release proof pointers after the MLLM tight-memory guard lane.
- Pushed `818899dc` to `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`: aligned the ZAYA-VL manifest proof assertion with the current MXFP4 thinking-capability artifact.
- Validation:
  - stale pointer scan clean for the targeted old artifact names.
  - `py_compile` passed for current suite/release/objective/public issue audit files.
  - focused proof-pointer pytest passed: `179 passed, 406 deselected`.
  - wrapper rerun wrote `build/current-regression-suite-after-dsv4-preflight-refresh-20260607.json` with `focused_regression_pytest` fixed.
- Current release boundary remains red, not packaged/signed/notarized:
  - `packaged_integrity_contracts` fails on bundled Python verifier/release-gate skip-app.
  - `release_regression_manifest` reports `current_proof_sweep=fail`, `prepackage_ready=false`, `release_ready=false`.
  - `release_gate_skip_app` fails at bundled Python import gate.
  - open objective rows: cross-family live multi-turn smoke, MiMo V2.5 runtime/tool/long-prompt quality, MiniMax-M2.7 reporter root cause, real Electron UI cross-family live model matrix, DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation quality.

## 2026-06-07 - Codex bundled Python refresh, package blocker surfacing, MiMo JANGTQ2 gate boundary

- Refreshed `panel/bundled-python` from `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard` with `./panel/scripts/bundle-python.sh`.
- Verified bundled runtime: `cd panel && npm run verify-bundled` passed, including bundled engine/JANG hash parity, MiMo V2 registration, Step3p7 VLM runtime, Gemma4 unified VLM/audio register, TurboQuant kernels, and Gemma4 vision coercion.
- Pushed `a4170d4b` to `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`: package integrity now surfaces `packaged_app_developer_id_signing_blocked` in top-level `failed` instead of reporting `status=fail` with `failed=[]`.
- Focused validation: `tests/test_packaged_integrity_contract.py` selected signing/package tests passed (`10 passed, 39 deselected`); refreshed package artifact reports `failed=["packaged_app_developer_id_signing_blocked"]`.
- Current suite refreshed at `build/current-regression-suite-after-dsv4-preflight-refresh-20260607.json`: `status=open`; failed steps are now only `packaged_integrity_contracts` and `release_regression_manifest`; `release_gate_skip_app` no longer fails.
- Remaining release blockers: staged app is ad-hoc/not hardened-runtime signed; prepackage/release manifest still false because cross-family live matrix, MiMo JANGTQ2 quality, MiniMax #179 root cause, real UI matrix, and DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation rows remain open.
- MiMo JANGTQ2 audit artifact `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-current-audit-after-jangtq2-packaged-speed-proof-20260607.json` proves manifest integrity and decode speed target but remains open for long-prompt coherence, tool protocol, CB/system-prompt working-set pressure, source-vs-quant first divergence, and media wiring. Do not release-clear MiMo from speed-only proof.

## 2026-06-07 - Codex stopped MiMo source-vs-quant due RAM boundary

Eric explicitly said not to do source-vs-quant comparison because there is not enough RAM. I stopped the local quant server attempt on `127.0.0.1:8897` and the Max2 source server attempt on `erics-m5-max2.local:8126`; no listener remains on either port.

MiMo `source_vs_quant_first_divergence=false` remains an honest open release blocker. Do not brute-force this lane again unless Eric reauthorizes it with enough RAM/headroom.

## 2026-06-07 - Codex signed staged Sequoia app and refreshed parser pointer

- Eric explicitly authorized signing. Signed `panel/release/sequoia-app/mac-arm64/vMLX.app` with `Developer ID Application: ShieldStack LLC (55KGF2S5AY)` and hardened runtime entitlements.
- Signing result: 500 bundled native files signed; `codesign --verify --deep --strict` passed; app reports `Authority=Developer ID Application: ShieldStack LLC (55KGF2S5AY)`, `TeamIdentifier=55KGF2S5AY`, runtime flag present.
- Refreshed packaged-integrity artifact: signing preflight now passes (`developer_id_signed=true`, `signature_is_adhoc=false`, `hardened_runtime_enabled=true`, `codesign_verify_rc=0`).
- Packaged-integrity is still not release-green because the staged app engine/source hash parity checks are false and dry release-gate objective digest pointer is false. This means the signed app is not a final current-source release artifact.
- Pushed `f7062c3d` to `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`: refreshed parser-registry proof pointer.
- Parser/tool/reasoning/max-output/VL focused slice passed: `15 passed, 29 deselected`.

## 2026-06-07 - release gate/cache API continuation

- Stayed in active Python/app worktree `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; did not touch deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, Swift, ADLab/TB/RDMA, or source-vs-quant.
- Fixed stale release-gate objective digest pointer in `panel/scripts/release-gate-python-app.py` and matching unit test.
- Pushed commit `6f36d3c1` to `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- Focused validation: `124 passed, 44 deselected` for packaged/current-suite/release-gate metadata tests.
- No-heavy cache/API/Responses validation: `run_noheavy_api_cache_contract.py` status `pass`; `run_api_surface_contract.py` status `pass`.
- Packaged integrity now passes standalone and inside aggregate suite: `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-after-staged-sequoia-rebuild-current-source-20260607.json` status `pass`, failed `[]`.
- Aggregate suite now has only `release_regression_manifest` failed: `build/current-regression-suite-after-dsv4-preflight-refresh-20260607.json` status `open`, failed_steps `['release_regression_manifest']`.
- Release remains blocked: `prepackage_ready=false`, `release_ready=false`; open rows are cross-family live multi-turn smoke, MiMo V2.5 runtime/tool/long-prompt quality, MiniMax reporter/root-cause, real Electron UI cross-family live matrix, and DSV4 long-output/code/file generation.
- Do not notarize, tag, publish, or update downloads from this state.

## 2026-06-07 - objective proof evidence pointer refresh

- Stayed in active Python/app worktree only.
- Fixed objective proof evidence lists so open release rows cite current existing 202606 artifacts instead of missing stale 202605 files.
- Did not change per-family validation payloads or mark any open row green; cross-family, MiMo, MiniMax, real UI, and DSV4 release rows remain open.
- Validation:
  - `py_compile` passed for `summarize_objective_proof.py` and `release_regression_manifest.py`.
  - Focused objective/manifest slice: `26 passed, 392 deselected`.
  - Refreshed objective digest has `missing_evidence_requirements=[]` and `open_requirement_detail_failures=[]`.
  - Aggregate suite is still `status=open`, now with failed_steps `['release_regression_manifest']` only.
- Pushed commit `1e8ce83b` to `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- Release remains blocked; no notarization/tag/public release allowed.

## 2026-06-07 - issue175-177 audit accounting refresh

- Ran dedicated #175-#177 audit scripts.
- Installed runtime audit now exists and passes at `build/current-issue175-177-installed-runtime-audit-20260602-v1554-installed-tahoe.json`.
- Live runtime audit now exists but fails at `build/current-issue175-177-live-runtime-audit-20260601-local-refresh.json`; source live-stress artifacts are absent, so checks for Qwen cache-hit TTFT/L2/paged+SSM, MiniMax paged+TQ/L2/restart, and admin sleep deep-unload are false. This remains a real live-proof blocker, not a missing-file blocker.
- Fixed `tests/test_issue175_177_live_runtime_audit.py` to use hermetic pass-case fixtures instead of assuming historical local build artifacts exist.
- Validation: `4 passed, 312 deselected` for #175-#177 installed/live audit tests; release manifest still `prepackage_ready=false`, `release_ready=false`.
- Current manifest no longer fails `issue175_177_installed_runtime_audit`; it still fails `issue175_177_live_runtime_audit` plus the broader live/MiMo/MiniMax/UI/DSV4 blockers.
- Pushed commit `1a472251` to `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.

## 2026-06-07 - issue175 admin sleep proof pointer

- Updated `run_issue175_177_live_runtime_audit.py` to use current admin sleep proof `build/current-issue175-admin-sleep-probe-after-gemma4-vlm-recovery-20260606.json` instead of missing 202605 installed artifact.
- Live #175-#177 audit now clears `admin_sleep_lifecycle_probe_passed=true` and `admin_sleep_deep_unload_observed=true`.
- Remaining live #175-#177 failures are real Qwen/MiniMax live cache stress rows: Qwen installed cache-hit TTFT/L2/paged+SSM/visible/metal metrics/capacity projection, MiniMax installed paged+TQ/TurboQuant/L2/latency/visible/restart reader/cold paged+disk+TQ.
- Validation: `tests/test_issue175_177_live_runtime_audit.py` focused slice passed; refreshed release manifest still `prepackage_ready=false`, `release_ready=false` with admin failures removed from `issue175_177_live_runtime_audit`.
- Pushed commit `b9fb7663` to `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.

## 2026-06-07 - Codex MiMo API/cache/Responses contract gate

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; did not touch deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, Swift, ADLab/TB/RDMA, or source-vs-quant.
- Added explicit MiMo audit gating for the no-heavy API/cache/Responses contract: Responses sampling, streaming cache-detail usage, `previous_response_id`, cache stats/reuse telemetry, cache warm/entries/clear endpoints, output-vs-context cap separation, Anthropic, and Ollama adapter surfaces.
- Boundary: this is source-route contract proof only. It does not clear live MiMo model output, tool exactness, cache-hit/L2 restart, media, UI, or release readiness.
- Refreshed artifacts:
  - `build/current-noheavy-api-cache-contract-after-qwen36-bundled-media-pass-20260607.json` -> status pass, missing_markers=[].
  - `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-current-audit-after-api-cache-responses-contract-20260607.json` -> status open, `component_ok.api_cache_responses_contract=true`.
  - `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-api-cache-responses-contract-20260607.json` -> current_proof_sweep=fail, prepackage_ready=false, release_ready=false.
- Focused validation passed:
  - MiMo/release slice: `19 passed, 295 deselected`.
  - MiMo/objective/release pointer slice: `127 passed, 293 deselected`.
- Current MiMo blockers remain: long-prompt coherence, tool protocol, JANGTQ2 exactness (`blue-cat` -> `blue cat`), CB system-prompt working-set pressure, source-vs-quant evidence gap, and unwired VL/audio/video.

## 2026-06-07 - Codex full-objective checklist and current-suite wiring

- Stayed in active Python/app worktree `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; did not touch deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, Swift, ADLab/TB/RDMA, source-vs-quant, package build, signing, notarization, tags, or public downloads.
- Updated local-only `AGENTS.md` with the full release objective: Python engine + MLXStudio app, all family live APIs, tools, JSON/XML/code exactness, cache reuse, prefix/paged/L2, native cache, media, UI, signing/notarization only after gates are green.
- Added no-heavy machine-readable checklist:
  - `tests/cross_matrix/run_full_release_objective_checklist.py`
  - `tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py`
  - artifact `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-20260607.json`
- Wired checklist into `run_current_regression_suite.py` and current-suite tests. Open checklist status is treated as expected blocker evidence, not a current-suite command failure.
- Fixed Gemma4 release-manifest proof wording so cold wall decode/TTFT remains tracked separately from visible stream TPS.
- Validation:
  - checklist tests: `2 passed`.
  - focused checklist/current-suite/Gemma4 manifest slice: `5 passed, 72 deselected`.
  - release-manifest source-hash/source-tracking slice: `5 passed, 308 deselected`.
  - aggregate current suite: `status=open`, failed_steps only `['release_regression_manifest']`; focused pytest is now clean.
- Current checklist open rows include: prepackage/release false, real UI matrix, MiMo long/tool/exactness/CB/source-vs-quant/media, Gemma4 media rows, Step3p7 real VLM, Nemotron Omni media rows, MiniMax #179 root cause, and DSV4 exactness/memory.

## 2026-06-07 - Codex structured-output gate hardening

- Stayed in active Python/app worktree only. No model loads, source-vs-quant, packaging, signing, notarization, tagging, public release, Swift, deprecated wrapper, ADLab, or TB/RDMA work.
- Hardened `run_noheavy_api_cache_contract.py` so JSON response-format/schema coverage is required:
  - chat streaming calls `parse_json_output` for response_format validation.
  - Responses streaming validates JSON format.
  - strict streaming JSON failures emit `json_validation_failed`.
  - Responses text format preserves `json_schema` data.
- Hardened `run_full_release_objective_checklist.py` so the full objective consumes `current-tool-call-contract-after-jangtq2-objective-refresh-20260607.json` and exposes XML/DSML/tool residue checks alongside API/cache/Responses checks.
- Refreshed artifacts:
  - `build/current-noheavy-api-cache-contract-after-qwen36-bundled-media-pass-20260607.json` -> status pass, missing_markers=[], API route contracts now 40 passed.
  - `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-20260607.json` -> status open, failed_count=17; JSON/XML/tool contract rows are green.
- Validation:
  - focused no-heavy/checklist/current-suite tests: `4 passed, 72 deselected`.
  - release-manifest/current-suite/checklist source-tracking slice: `8 passed, 381 deselected`.
- Remaining blockers unchanged: release is still blocked by live family/UI/model rows, not by source-route JSON/XML/tool contract gaps.

## 2026-06-07 - Codex full-objective checklist manifest alignment

- Stayed in active Python/app worktree only; no model loads, source-vs-quant, package build, signing, notarization, tagging, public release, Swift, deprecated wrapper, ADLab, or TB/RDMA work.
- Fixed full-objective checklist artifact drift:
  - `run_full_release_objective_checklist.py` now reads the canonical current-suite release manifest `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-issue179-public-dmg-provenance-20260607.json`.
  - `run_current_regression_suite.py` now regenerates `full_release_objective_checklist` after `release_regression_manifest`, so checklist status reflects the current manifest instead of a stale side artifact.
- Validation:
  - focused checklist/current-suite ordering tests: `5 passed, 71 deselected`.
  - aggregate current suite refreshed: `build/current-regression-suite-after-full-objective-checklist-20260607.json` -> status open, failed_steps only `['release_regression_manifest']`.
- The checklist remains open for real blockers: cross-family live multi-turn smoke, MiMo runtime/tool/long-prompt/exactness/media, MiniMax #179 root cause, real Electron UI live matrix, and DSV4 long-output/code/file quality.

## 2026-06-07 - Codex Qwen 3.6 MTP checklist hardening

- Stayed in active Python/app worktree only; no model loads, source-vs-quant, package build, signing, notarization, tagging, public release, Swift, deprecated wrapper, ADLab, or TB/RDMA work.
- Strengthened `run_full_release_objective_checklist.py` Qwen 3.6 rows from artifact-presence checks to evidence checks:
  - Qwen27 MXFP4 MTP Responses cancel: streaming response id, cancel route 200, no bad text, native MTP active, hybrid SSM cache policy.
  - Qwen27 API parity: Responses text, required tool, Anthropic, Ollama, chat SSE, MTP active, `hybrid_ssm_v1`, cache-hit tokens, block L2 writes/hits, SSM companion disk stores.
  - Qwen27 restart/L2: phase1 block/SSM stores, phase2 `paged+ssm+disk` cached tokens, block L2 hit, native cache, MTP active.
  - Qwen35 MXFP8 MTP startup: model loaded, native MTP active, depth 3, `hybrid_ssm_v1`, trained K=8 preserved.
  - Qwen35 long Responses/tool/cache: 3 turns, previous_response_id, cache reuse each later turn, `paged+ssm`, block/SSM L2, tool calls, no XML/tool leak, no loop tail, final no-tools visible output, plus explicit overall/tool-evidence grounding checks.
- Current result: Qwen27 rows are green. Qwen35 rows are green for MTP/cache/reuse/L2/no-leak/no-loop, but open for `qwen35_long_tool_cache_overall_pass=False` and `qwen35_long_tool_cache_tool_evidence_grounded=False` from the current artifact.
- Validation:
  - `tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py` -> `2 passed`.
  - focused current-suite/checklist tests -> `4 passed, 72 deselected`.
  - aggregate current suite refreshed -> status open, failed_steps only `['release_regression_manifest']`.
- Refreshed artifact: `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-20260607.json` now has failed_count=19 due the newly surfaced Qwen35 grounding blockers.

## 2026-06-07 - Codex panel settings checklist hardening

- Stayed in active Python/app worktree only; no model loads, source-vs-quant, package build, signing, notarization, tagging, public release, Swift, deprecated wrapper, ADLab, or TB/RDMA work.
- Hardened `run_full_release_objective_checklist.py` so the release objective directly consumes `build/current-panel-settings-contract-proof-20260601-cache-ui-storage-quant.json`.
- New checklist group `ui_settings_parser_cache_contract` requires panel settings status pass, coverage count, no missing source markers, DSV4 native cache controls, generic KV suppression, max output/context split, chat max-output override, MiniMax parser detection, native MTP D3 policy, model-family parser registry, engine cache architecture registry, panel-emitted CLI flag registration, and panel typecheck.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` local-only guard to name this panel settings contract as a release prerequisite while preserving the rule that it is not a substitute for real Electron live-model proof.
- Validation: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py -q` -> 2 passed.
- Refreshed `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-20260607.json` -> status open, failed_count=19. Open rows are still real release blockers: prepackage/release false, real UI live matrix, MiMo long/tool/exactness/CB/source-vs-quant/media, Qwen35 tool evidence, Gemma4 media, Step3p7 real VLM, Nemotron Omni media, MiniMax #179, and DSV4 exactness/memory.

## 2026-06-07 - Codex Qwen35 tool-evidence gate fairness fix

- Stayed in active Python/app worktree only; no package build, signing, notarization, tagging, public release, Swift, deprecated wrapper, ADLab, TB/RDMA, or source-vs-quant work.
- Inspected `build/current-qwen35-mxfp8-mtp-responses-long-tool-cache-20260607/summary.json` and raw turn artifacts. Current Qwen35 failure is specifically `tool_evidence_each_required_turn=false`; previous_response_id, `paged+ssm`, block/SSM L2, tool calls, no raw tool markup leak, no loop tail, and final no-tools visible output are green.
- Found proof-harness fairness issue: a model-chosen bad `inspect_symbol` path could produce `is not a readable file` with no file:line marker, while strict `--require-tool-evidence` requires citing a marker from tool output.
- Patched `tests/cross_matrix/run_responses_long_tool_cache_gate.py` so unreadable/missing in-repo inspect targets include a fallback in-repo file:line marker. This preserves strict grounding while making the evidence contract satisfiable.
- Updated existing gate unit test to require a fallback file:line marker for bad paths.
- Validation: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_engine_audit.py -q -k "responses_long_context_tool_cache_gate"` -> 20 passed.
- Release boundary: Qwen35 remains open until a live long Responses/tool/cache rerun passes grounded tool evidence with this fixed harness.

## 2026-06-07 - Codex Qwen35 live native-MTP required-tool rerun

- Stayed in active Python/app worktree only; no package build, signing, notarization, tagging, public release, Swift, deprecated wrapper, ADLab, TB/RDMA, or source-vs-quant work.
- Relaunched Qwen35 MXFP8 MTP through supported `vmlx serve` CLI in a persistent foreground tool session after finding background launch processes are cleaned up by the tool shell.
- Correct release launch nuance: direct `python -m vmlx_engine.server` bypassed current CLI cache flag translation; explicit `--kv-cache-quantization q4` disables JANG-calibrated live TurboQuant KV. The valid gate launch omitted explicit KV quantization and used `VMLINUX_FORCE_TQ_AUTO=1`, `--use-paged-cache`, `--enable-block-disk-cache`, `--native-mtp-sampling-policy compatible-only`, parser flags, and deterministic request sampling.
- Health proof showed Qwen35 native MTP active at depth 3, hybrid SSM typed cache, live TurboQuant attention KV enabled, q4 storage-boundary cache enabled, and block disk/SSM L2 active.
- Ran `tests/cross_matrix/run_responses_long_tool_cache_gate.py` with 3 turns, deterministic sampling, `tool_choice=required`, in-turn tool resolution, strict tool evidence, strict cache-each-turn, final turn no tools/thinking disabled.
- Patched the gate to preserve HTTP error responses in rows/SUMMARY instead of aborting before evidence write; focused gate tests still passed (`20 passed`), combined focused slice passed (`22 passed`).
- Fresh artifact `build/current-qwen35-mxfp8-mtp-responses-long-tool-cache-after-tool-fallback-20260607/SUMMARY.json` -> `overall_pass=false`: turn 1 grounded tool evidence passed, turn 2 returned HTTP 400 because required tool produced no tool call, turn 3 visible final output and cache reuse passed.
- Updated full release checklist Qwen35 pointer to this artifact and added explicit `qwen35_long_tool_cache_no_http_errors`; refreshed checklist is `status=open`, failed_count=21. Qwen35 current blockers are no-http-errors, required tool each turn, strict cache each later turn after the 400, and overall pass.
- Aggregate current suite refreshed: `build/current-regression-suite-after-full-objective-checklist-20260607.json` -> status open, failed_steps only `['release_regression_manifest']`.
- Release boundary: Qwen35 is not release-cleared. The current blocker is deterministic native-MTP required-tool compliance / Responses HTTP 400 under `tool_choice=required`, not gdn_sink, MTP autodetect, TurboQuant/L2 availability, or raw XML/tool leakage.

## 2026-06-07 - Codex Responses required-tool raw preview parity

- Stayed in active Python/app worktree only; no package build, signing, notarization, tagging, public release, Swift, deprecated wrapper, ADLab, TB/RDMA, or source-vs-quant work.
- Inspected required-tool enforcement after the Qwen35 live native-MTP gate returned HTTP 400 on turn 2. Chat Completions already logged `raw_preview`, but Responses only logged a generic warning before raising 400.
- Patched `vmlx_engine/server.py` so Responses required-tool failures log the cleaned parse preview before returning strict HTTP 400. This does not fabricate tool calls or weaken `tool_choice=required`; it preserves diagnostics needed to classify future parser-vs-model failures.
- Updated `tests/test_engine_audit.py` to require both required-tool enforcement paths to include `raw_preview` and to pin the current XML-function rendered ChatML splice fallback instead of an old brittle message-list mutation string.
- Validation: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_engine_audit.py -q -k "xml_function_tool_fallback_requires_concrete_function_examples or responses_long_context_tool_cache_gate or required"` -> 30 passed.
- Release boundary: Qwen35 remains blocked on required-tool compliance under deterministic native-MTP Responses; this diagnostic patch only improves future evidence quality.

## 2026-06-07 - Codex Qwen35 auto-tool-choice classification

- Stayed in active Python/app worktree only; no package build, signing, notarization, tagging, public release, Swift, deprecated wrapper, ADLab, TB/RDMA, or source-vs-quant work.
- Relaunched Qwen35 MXFP8 MTP through supported `vmlx serve` with `--enable-auto-tool-choice`, explicit qwen parser, deterministic request sampling, native-MTP compatible policy, paged cache, block disk L2, and auto TurboQuant attention KV.
- Fresh artifact: `build/current-qwen35-mxfp8-mtp-responses-long-tool-cache-auto-tool-choice-20260607/SUMMARY.json` -> `overall_pass=false`.
- Turn 1 passed: required `grep_repo` tool call, exact grounded `TOOL_EVIDENCE`, no tool-markup leak.
- Turn 2 failed: `/v1/responses` HTTP 400 because `tool_choice=required` produced no tool call. Server `raw_preview` shows ordinary prose about `CACHE_CORRUPTION_PATTERNS`, not raw tool syntax. This classifies the failure as model required-tool noncompliance under the strict deterministic native-MTP Responses gate, not a parser miss.
- Turn 3 passed final no-tools visible output and cache reuse. Cache telemetry showed hybrid SSM typed cache, live TurboQuant attention KV, q4 storage-boundary cache, block disk L2 writes/hits, SSM L2 stores, and native MTP active.
- Updated full checklist Qwen35 pointer to the auto-tool-choice artifact; refreshed `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-20260607.json` remains open with failed_count=21.
- Validation: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py tests/test_engine_audit.py -q -k "full_release_objective_checklist or xml_function_tool_fallback_requires_concrete_function_examples or responses_long_context_tool_cache_gate or required"` -> 32 passed.
- Release boundary: Qwen35 remains blocked until model/tool behavior can satisfy required tool calls across multi-turn Responses; runtime cache/MTP/TQ/L2 pieces are not the current failing component.

## 2026-06-07 Codex | Qwen required-tool Responses prompt contract tightened

- Active blocker reduced: Qwen 3.6 35B MXFP8-MTP `/v1/responses` long tool/cache gate where cache/L2/MTP/TurboQuant evidence was present but `tool_choice=required` turn 2 emitted prose instead of a native tool call.
- Patched `vmlx_engine/api/tool_calling.py` so Qwen native fallback tool instructions detect `tool_choice=required` from template kwargs and explicitly require exactly one native tool call before any prose.
- This is pre-generation model-facing instruction only. It does not synthesize or repair a missing tool call after generation; strict HTTP 400 enforcement remains intact.
- Added focused coverage in `tests/test_tool_format.py` for Qwen required-tool fallback instructions and concrete native function examples.
- Validation: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_tool_format.py -q -k "qwen_required_tool_choice_fallback_injects_hard_first_call_contract or qwen_fallback_injects_concrete_native_tool_example"` -> 2 passed. `py_compile` for `vmlx_engine/api/tool_calling.py` and `tests/test_tool_format.py` passed.
- Remaining proof: rerun live Qwen35 Responses long-tool-cache gate with canonical `VMLX_FORCE_TQ_AUTO=1` to determine whether turn-2 required-tool compliance is cleared.

## 2026-06-07 Codex | Qwen35 required-tool/cache live rerun after template plumbing

- Active blocker reduced: Qwen 3.6 35B MXFP8-MTP `/v1/responses` long tool/cache gate.
- Source fixes applied:
  - `vmlx_engine/api/tool_calling.py`: Qwen fallback prompt detects `tool_choice=required`, adds hard first native tool-call contract, and appends a current-turn required-tool reminder to the latest user message.
  - `vmlx_engine/server.py`: Chat Completions and Responses non-streaming paths now forward `tool_choice` into `chat_template_kwargs` so fallback prompt injection sees the same contract the API enforces.
  - Tests updated in `tests/test_tool_format.py` and `tests/test_engine_audit.py`.
- Focused validation passed: `tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py tests/test_tool_format.py tests/test_engine_audit.py -k "full_release_objective_checklist or qwen_required_tool_choice_fallback_injects_hard_first_call_contract or qwen_fallback_injects_concrete_native_tool_example or V4bToolChoiceRequired"` -> 8 passed. `py_compile` passed for edited files.
- Live proof artifact: `build/current-qwen35-mxfp8-mtp-responses-long-tool-cache-after-current-turn-required-reminder-20260607/SUMMARY.json`.
- Live result remains red: `overall_pass=false`; turn 1 produced `grep_repo` and grounded evidence, turn 2 returned HTTP 400 because `tool_choice=required` produced no model tool call, turn 3 produced visible final answer with `cached_tokens=128`.
- Runtime/cache evidence in this run remains good: native MTP active with tool-context D1 cap, `paged+ssm` cache hit, TurboQuant KV recompress/dequantize, block disk L2 writes/hits, and SSM companion L2 stores.
- Current classification: runtime cache/TQ/L2/MTP path is active; Qwen35 chained Responses required-tool behavior remains a model/tool-policy compliance blocker after runtime prompt plumbing. No fake post-generation tool-call injection was added.
- Full checklist refreshed: `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-qwen35-required-reminder-20260607.json` -> `status=open`, `failed_count=21`.

## 2026-06-07 Codex | MiMo JANGTQ2 tool protocol vs exactness split

- Active blocker reduced: MiMo V2.5 JANGTQ2 release audit taxonomy.
- Current no-media smoke artifact shows MiMo emits a real `record_fact` tool call, but mutates literal `blue-cat` to `blue cat` in tool args and structured JSON.
- Patched `tests/cross_matrix/run_mimo_v2_jang2l_current_audit.py` so current JANGTQ2 smoke owns the tool-protocol row; older synced/CB tool failures no longer override current parsed-tool evidence when a current smoke artifact exists.
- Exact literal failures remain red under `mimo_jangtq2_artifact_exactness_blocked`; no parser fake/argument rewrite was added.
- Focused tests passed: `tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py tests/test_mimo_v2_current_audit.py -k "full_release_objective_checklist or tool_protocol_is_separate_from_literal_argument_exactness or current_smoke_tool_protocol_beats_legacy_synced_tool_failure or current_audit"` -> 5 passed. `py_compile` passed for touched audit/checklist files.
- Refreshed MiMo audit: `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-current-audit-after-tool-protocol-exactness-split-20260607.json` -> `status=open`, `tool_protocol=true`, `artifact_exactness=false`.
- Refreshed full checklist: `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-mimo-tool-protocol-exactness-split-20260607.json` -> `status=open`, `failed_count=20`.
- Remaining MiMo blockers: long-prompt coherence, JANGTQ2 artifact exactness (`blue-cat` -> `blue cat`), CB system-prompt working-set pressure, source-vs-quant missing endpoints, and VL/audio/video unwired.

## 2026-06-07 - MiMo XML parser exactness and Responses/cache gate update

- Added focused parser regression: `tests/test_xml_function_tool_parser.py::TestXMLFunctionToolParser::test_hyphenated_literal_parameter_is_preserved`.
- Result: passed. The MiMo XML function parser preserves `blue-cat` as a literal parameter value and does not mutate it to `blue cat`.
- Classification: current MiMo `blue-cat -> blue cat` failures are not explained by XML parser mutation; keep them under `mimo_jangtq2_artifact_exactness_blocked` unless later live evidence proves a runtime decode bug.
- Release gate reminder: cache reuse and `/v1/responses` endpoint behavior remain explicit blockers. Required proof is multi-turn Responses API with stable request state, no HTTP 400/500, real tool-call continuation where required, cached-token reuse on later turns, parser selection honored, and no fake injected tool calls.

## 2026-06-07 - Qwen35 Responses cache/tool gate cleared after historical-tool-result prompt fix

- Fixed a Qwen required-tool fallback ambiguity in `vmlx_engine/api/tool_calling.py`: historical tool results in a chained Responses conversation no longer satisfy the current-turn `tool_choice=required` instruction.
- Added/updated focused coverage:
  - `tests/test_tool_format.py::TestToolPromptFallback::test_qwen_required_tool_choice_fallback_injects_hard_first_call_contract`
  - `tests/test_xml_function_tool_parser.py::TestXMLFunctionToolParser::test_hyphenated_literal_parameter_is_preserved`
- Focused validation passed: `tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py tests/test_tool_format.py tests/test_xml_function_tool_parser.py -k "full_release_objective_checklist or qwen_required_tool_choice_fallback_injects_hard_first_call_contract or hyphenated_literal_parameter_is_preserved"` -> 4 passed.
- Live Qwen35 gate rerun against current source `vmlx serve` passed:
  - artifact: `build/current-qwen35-mxfp8-mtp-responses-long-tool-cache-after-historical-tool-required-20260607/SUMMARY.json`
  - turn 1: HTTP 200, tool call emitted, cached_tokens=0
  - turn 2: HTTP 200, tool call emitted, cached_tokens=128
  - turn 3: HTTP 200, tools disabled final visible answer, cached_tokens=256
  - `overall_pass=True`
- Runtime proof included `/v1/responses`, `previous_response_id`, strict required tools, in-turn tool resolution, strict tool evidence, cache reuse each later turn, paged+SSM cache detail, block disk L2, SSM companion L2, live TurboQuant KV recompress, and native MTP active under compatible sampling.
- Full release checklist refreshed: `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-qwen35-cache-responses-pass-20260607.json` -> `status=open`, `failed_count=16`. Qwen35 cache/Responses rows are no longer open.

## 2026-06-07 - MiMo sentinel exactness proof added; release still locked

- Added MiMo-only sentinel exactness probes to `bench/all_local_model_smoke.py`:
  - `mimo_tool_required_sentinel` expects `record_fact({"value":"B7-CAT-09"})`.
  - `mimo_structured_json_sentinel` expects `{ "status":"ok", "value":"B7-CAT-09", "count":3 }`.
- Existing `tool_required` and `structured_json_exact` `blue-cat` gates remain strict and unchanged; this is diagnostic evidence, not a fake pass.
- Focused tests passed:
  - `tests/test_all_local_model_smoke.py`
  - `tests/test_mimo_v2_current_audit.py`
  - `tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py`
  - focused result: `10 passed`.
- Live MiMo JANGTQ2 no-media smoke rerun:
  - artifact: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-mimo-v25-jangtq2-bundled-tools-nomedia-20260607/summary.json`
  - status: `fail`, 4 failures.
  - `tool_required`: expected `blue-cat`, actual `blue-123`.
  - `mimo_tool_required_sentinel`: expected `B7-CAT-09`, actual `B7CAT-09`.
  - `structured_json_exact`: expected `blue-cat`, actual `bluecat`.
  - `mimo_structured_json_sentinel`: expected `B7-CAT-09`, actual `B7CCAT-09`.
- Classification: MiMo exactness failure is broader literal-copy/punctuation corruption, not just semantic dehyphenation of `blue-cat` and not XML parser mutation.
- Runtime/cache evidence from the same run remains separately useful:
  - tool protocol emits real `record_fact` calls.
  - generation TPS about `48.9`, above the accepted speed floor.
  - native cache family `mimo_v2`, schema `mixed_swa_kv_v1`, storage-boundary q4, prefix+paged+block-L2 enabled.
  - latest cache execution had `cached_tokens=128`, `cache_detail=paged`, reconstruction/dequantization OK.
  - block disk L2 wrote 25 blocks / 1262 tokens.
- Updated MiMo audit pointer and regenerated:
  - `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-current-audit-after-sentinel-exactness-proof-20260607.json`
  - status remains `open`.
- Updated full objective checklist pointer and regenerated:
  - `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-mimo-sentinel-exactness-proof-20260607.json`
  - status `open`, failed_count `16`.

Do not package, sign, notarize, tag, push release, or update downloads. MiMo remains blocked by long-prompt coherence, artifact exactness, CB working-set pressure, source-vs-quant/equivalent classification, and media wiring.

## 2026-06-07 - DSV4 exactness preflight refreshed after MiMo sentinel run

- Reran DSV4 route-mode code exactness memory preflight only:
  - artifact: `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-preflight-after-release-manifest-refresh-20260607.json`
  - status: `skipped`
  - reason: `insufficient_vm_stat_memory`
  - required_available_gb: `120.0`
  - available_for_gate_gb: `53.27`
  - memory_gap_gb: `66.73`
  - active_heavy_process_count: `0`
  - launch_decision: `do_not_launch`
- Did not launch DSV4. This remains a real memory/resource gate, not a runtime pass.
- Updated full objective checklist pointer and regenerated:
  - `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-dsv4-preflight-refresh-20260607.json`
  - status `open`, failed_count `16`.

## 2026-06-07 - Gemma4 12B JANG_4M image media row cleared in current source

- Verified current VLM image prefill guard is already memory-aware in source:
  - default single-buffer guard scales with Metal working set.
  - explicit `VMLINUX_VLM_IMAGE_PREFILL_BUFFER_GB=8` preserves the old 8GB cap.
  - focused VLM guard tests passed.
- Ran live Gemma4 12B JANG_4M image media smoke:
  - artifact: `build/current-gemma4-12b-jang4m-media-smoke-after-vlm-prefill-guard-20260607.json`
  - status: `pass`
  - row: `jang4m_image`
  - chat code: `200`
  - content: `Red`
  - checks: capabilities ok, vision advertised, visible answer, red detected, no channel leak.
- Wired that artifact into `tests/cross_matrix/run_full_release_objective_checklist.py` instead of hard-failing Gemma4 media unconditionally.
- Focused validation passed:
  - `tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py`
  - `tests/test_vl_video_regression.py -k vlm_image_prefill_*`
  - result: `4 passed`.
- Refreshed full checklist:
  - `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-gemma4-jang4m-media-pass-20260607.json`
  - status `open`, failed_count `15`.

Release remains locked. This clears only the current Gemma4 12B JANG_4M image media row; audio/video broader media matrices still remain represented by other open family rows where applicable.

## 2026-06-07 - Nemotron Omni media/cache row cleared in current source

- Live Nemotron Omni MXFP4 media gate passed:
  - artifact: `build/current-nemotron-omni-mxfp4-media-gate-20260607/SUMMARY.json`
  - status: `PASS`
  - requests: `image_blue`, `video_blue`, `audio_blue`, `turn2_recall` all HTTP 200.
  - outputs: image/video/audio `Blue`; turn-2 recall `color=blue, animal=cat`.
- The proof includes cache and L2 evidence:
  - turn-2 recall: `cached_tokens=24`, `cache_detail=paged+ssm`.
  - final cache: native `nemotron_h` `hybrid_ssm_v1`, block disk L2 writes/hits, SSM companion disk stores, L2 block/SSM tokens on disk.
  - log tail confirms `/v1/chat/completions` route for the media requests.
- Wired `tests/cross_matrix/run_full_release_objective_checklist.py` to require the current Nemotron media gate instead of a placeholder hard fail.
- Focused validation:
  - `py_compile` passed for checklist runner and test.
  - `tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py`: `2 passed`.
- Refreshed checklist:
  - `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-nemotron-media-cache-pass-20260607.json`
  - status `open`, failed_count `14`.

Release remains locked. Nemotron media/cache is green, but packaging/UI, MiMo, Step3.7 real VLM, MiniMax #179, and DSV4 rows remain open.

## 2026-06-07 - MiMo media/runtime metadata classified without fake clearance

- Added MiMo media/runtime classification to `tests/cross_matrix/run_mimo_v2_jang2l_current_audit.py`.
- Focused validation:
  - `py_compile` passed for MiMo audit and full checklist runner/tests.
  - `tests/test_mimo_v2_current_audit.py`: `3 passed`.
  - `tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py`: `2 passed`.
- Current MiMo audit:
  - artifact: `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-current-audit-after-media-runtime-metadata-classification-20260607.json`
  - status: `open`
  - media classification: `runtime_implementation_gap_with_model_metadata_overadvertising`.
- Current media evidence:
  - media weights preserved: 364 `visual.*` tensors, 95 audio/speech tensors, `preprocessor_config.json`, `audio_tokenizer/`.
  - runtime capabilities safe: `/capabilities` exposes `modalities=["text"]` and marks vision/image/video/audio as `preserved_unwired`.
  - runtime implementation missing: `VisionModel`/`AudioModel` stubs, `visual.*`/`audio_encoder.*` skipped at load, image `pixel_values` raises unsupported modality, no `mimo_v2_multimodal.py`.
  - model metadata over-advertises: `config.json` has `capabilities.modalities=["text","vision","audio"]` and lacks the text-runtime preserved/unwired metadata contract.
- Updated full checklist pointer:
  - `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-mimo-media-runtime-metadata-classification-20260607.json`
  - status `open`, failed_count `14`.

Release remains locked. This is not a MiMo media fix; it is a precise model-vs-runtime classification and a guard against fake media clearance.

## 2026-06-07 - MiMo media subgates exposed in full release checklist

- Added first-class full-checklist rows for MiMo media subgates:
  - `mimo_media_weights_preserved`
  - `mimo_media_runtime_capabilities_safe`
  - `mimo_media_model_metadata_text_only_contract`
  - `mimo_media_runtime_implementation`
  - `mimo_mimo_media_wired`
- Focused validation:
  - `py_compile` passed for full checklist runner/test.
  - `tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py`: `2 passed`.
- Current full checklist:
  - `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-mimo-media-subgates-20260607.json`
  - status `open`, failed_count `16`.
- The failed count increased because MiMo metadata and real media runtime implementation are now independently visible. This is not a new runtime regression.

Release remains locked.

## 2026-06-07 - MiniMax issue179 subgates exposed in full release checklist

- Replaced the collapsed `issue179_root_cause` simple status row in `tests/cross_matrix/run_full_release_objective_checklist.py` with explicit MiniMax #179 rows.
- Green rows from the current artifact:
  - current source Responses cancel contract
  - latest public DMG cancel route
  - local installed bundle cancel route
  - local installed live cancel probe
  - local real UI diagnostics clean
  - installed session/settings parity
- Remaining red rows:
  - root cause status pass
  - reporter parity artifact
  - reporter server hash parity
  - reporter prompt reproduction or reporter-log proof
- Focused validation:
  - `py_compile` passed for full checklist runner/test.
  - `tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py`: `2 passed`.
- Current full checklist:
  - `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-issue179-subgates-20260607.json`
  - status `open`, failed_count `19`.

Release remains locked. MiniMax #179 is not a current-source cancel-route blocker now; it remains a reporter parity/provenance/reproduction blocker.

## 2026-06-07 - Step3.7 VLM subgates exposed in full release checklist

- Wired `build/current-step37-vlm-runtime-audit-after-gemma4-vl-refresh-20260606.json` into `tests/cross_matrix/run_full_release_objective_checklist.py`.
- Added Step3.7 rows:
  - `step37_vlm_runtime_audit_exists`
  - `step37_vlm_noheavy_runtime_surface`
  - `step37_vlm_rejects_fake_clearance_paths`
  - `step37_real_vlm_runtime_complete`
- Current evidence:
  - text/no-media smoke is green with required tool call, multiturn recall, reasoning, `paged` cache hit, and `step3p7_full_sliding_kv`.
  - no-heavy VLM runtime audit is green: Step3p7 runtime symbols and source-owned vision/projector/processor surfaces exist.
  - live image/video media proof remains missing, so `step37_real_vlm_runtime_complete` remains red.
- Focused validation:
  - `py_compile` passed for full checklist runner/test.
  - `tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py`: `2 passed`.
- Current full checklist:
  - `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-step37-vlm-subgates-20260607.json`
  - status `open`, failed_count `19`.

Release remains locked.

## 2026-06-07 - API/cache and DSV4 memory subgates tightened

- Added parent `status=pass` enforcement for the no-heavy API/cache artifact so cache reuse, `/v1/responses`, previous_response_id, streaming cache telemetry, output cap, JSON response format/schema, Anthropic, and Ollama rows cannot pass under a failed parent proof.
- Replaced collapsed DSV4 exactness rows with explicit memory/preflight rows:
  - artifact exists
  - memory floor valid
  - heavy-process context clean
  - safe no-launch behavior under insufficient memory
  - resource availability
  - exactness status pass
  - exactness case matrix present
  - exact code/file long-output complete
- Current DSV4 artifact remains a safe skip for `insufficient_vm_stat_memory`, not a release pass. Release remains locked.
- Refreshed checklist: `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-dsv4-memory-subgates-20260607.json`, status `open`, failed_count `20`.

## 2026-06-07 - MiMo metadata text-runtime contract corrected

- Patched promoted local MiMo config metadata for `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/MiMo-V2.5-JANGTQ_2`:
  - runtime modalities now text-only.
  - vision/audio are marked preserved and unwired.
  - multimodal status is `weights_preserved_text_runtime`.
- Updated `build/current-mimo-jangtq2-local-manifest-20260607.tsv` for the config size change.
- Refreshed MiMo audit: `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-current-audit-after-artifact-exactness-boundary-20260607.json`.
- Refreshed full checklist: `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-mimo-metadata-contract-20260607.json`, status `open`, failed_count `19`.
- Important boundary: this is not a fake VL/audio fix. It prevents metadata over-routing while keeping real MiMo media runtime rows red.

## 2026-06-07 - Release manifest pointer refreshed after MiMo metadata contract

- Regenerated compact release manifest with `tests/cross_matrix/run_release_regression_manifest.py`:
  - `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-issue179-public-dmg-provenance-20260607.json`
  - rows: 26
  - `current_proof_sweep=fail`
  - `prepackage_ready=false`
  - `release_ready=false`
- Updated the full objective checklist to read this current manifest and use `current_proof_sweep.component_ok` for packaged integrity and real UI matrix rows.
- Focused validation passed:
  - `tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py`
  - `tests/test_release_regression_manifest.py`
  - result: `315 passed`
- Refreshed top-level checklist: `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-release-manifest-refresh-20260607.json`, status `open`, failed_count `17`.
- This does not clear packaging/signing/notarization. It keeps the release lock current.

## 2026-06-07 - DSV4 preflight and current proof artifacts refreshed

- Ran DSV4 route-mode exactness preflight only:
  - artifact: `build/current-dsv4-route-mode-code-exactness-preflight-after-release-manifest-refresh-20260607.json`
  - status: `skipped`
  - reason: `insufficient_vm_stat_memory`
  - did_not_launch: `true`
  - available_for_gate_gb: `53.27`
  - required_available_gb: `120.0`
  - memory_gap_gb: `66.73`
  - active_heavy_process_count: `0`
- Refreshed no-heavy proof artifacts:
  - objective digest: `build/current-objective-proof-after-dsv4-preflight-refresh-20260607.json`
  - release manifest: `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-issue179-public-dmg-provenance-20260607.json`
  - aggregate current suite: `build/current-regression-suite-after-dsv4-preflight-refresh-20260607.json`
  - full checklist: `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-dsv4-preflight-refresh-20260607.json`
- Aggregate suite remains open: failed steps are `packaged_integrity_contracts`, `release_regression_manifest`, `release_gate_skip_app`.
- Focused DSV4/release/objective validation passed: `70 passed, 351 deselected`.
- Release remains locked.

## 2026-06-07 - MiniMax #179 public DMG provenance narrowed

- Downloaded missing public release DMGs:
  - `vMLX-1.5.50-sequoia-arm64.dmg`
  - `vMLX-1.5.50-tahoe-arm64.dmg`
  - `vMLX-1.5.52-sequoia-arm64.dmg`
  - `vMLX-1.5.52-tahoe-arm64.dmg`
- Generated no-heavy DMG server route/hash contracts for v1.5.50 and v1.5.52. All have cancel route and engine abort marker.
- Refreshed MiniMax audit:
  - `build/current-issue179-minimax-k-root-cause-audit-after-public-dmg-provenance-refresh-20260607.json`
  - `public_release_checked_count=6`
  - `missing_required_public_release_contracts=[]`
  - status remains `open`.
- Remaining #179 blocker: reporter server hash drift/provenance unknown plus missing reporter parity artifact and no local bad-text reproduction.
- Focused validation passed: `64 passed, 268 deselected`.
- Refreshed release/checklist artifacts:
  - `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-issue179-public-dmg-provenance-20260607.json`
  - `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-issue179-public-dmg-provenance-20260607.json`
- Release remains locked.

## 2026-06-07 - Codex MiMo sentinel pointer refresh and current gate rerun
- Refreshed stale MiMo evidence pointers from older media/literal prompt probes to the current sentinel JANGTQ2 proof: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-mimo-v25-jangtq2-bundled-tools-nomedia-20260607/summary.json`.
- Updated objective digest/current-suite/release-manifest pointers to:
  - `build/current-objective-proof-after-mimo-sentinel-pointer-refresh-20260607.json`
  - `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-mimo-sentinel-pointer-refresh-20260607.json`
  - `build/current-regression-suite-after-mimo-sentinel-pointer-refresh-20260607.json`
- Current MiMo evidence remains red for exact literal preservation, not for cache availability or parser mutation. Parsed tool calls exist, tool-result continuation works, cache hits are present, but model output mutates sentinel literals. No fake parser rewrite was added.
- Aggregate current suite rerun completed: status `open`; failed steps `packaged_integrity_contracts`, `release_regression_manifest`, `release_gate_skip_app`; open requirements remain cross-family live matrix, MiMo, MiniMax #179, real UI cross-family matrix, and DSV4 long-output/code/file-generation.
- Focused validation passed: MiMo/objective digest `7 passed`; objective/release/current-suite pointer slice `420 passed`; release/checklist/current-suite slice `318 passed`; release manifest focused suite `313 passed`.
- Release remains locked. No signing, notarization, tag, push, or public download update was performed.

## 2026-06-07 - Codex MiMo exactness-boundary audit
- Added `artifact_exactness_boundary` to `run_mimo_v2_jang2l_current_audit.py` and regression coverage in `tests/test_mimo_v2_current_audit.py`.
- Generated `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-current-audit-after-artifact-exactness-boundary-20260607.json`.
- Current classification: valid parser/tool/JSON structure with wrong generated literal values, i.e. `model_generated_literal_mutation_after_valid_parser_structure`.
- Concrete examples from the current sentinel proof: `blue-cat -> blue-123`, `B7-CAT-09 -> B7CAT-09`, `blue-cat -> bluecat`, `B7-CAT-09 -> B7CCAT-09`.
- Refreshed objective/release/checklist/current-suite proof chain to `*-after-mimo-exactness-boundary-20260607.json` artifacts.
- Validation passed: MiMo audit tests `3 passed`; focused MiMo/checklist/objective/release suite `424 passed`; final focused proof chain `429 passed, 69 deselected`.
- Aggregate suite remains open with real release blockers. No commit, push, signing, notarization, tag, or public release was performed.

## 2026-06-07 - Codex ZAYA text current-smoke pointer refresh
- Fixed stale objective-digest evidence for `zaya_text`: the digest now uses `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-zaya-text-vl-tools-media-after-reasoning-budget-20260606/summary.json` instead of missing `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-zaya-text-bundled-20260524/summary.json`.
- Regenerated proof chain:
  - `build/current-objective-proof-after-zaya-text-current-smoke-refresh-20260607.json`
  - `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-zaya-text-current-smoke-refresh-20260607.json`
  - `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-zaya-text-current-smoke-refresh-20260607.json`
  - `build/current-regression-suite-after-zaya-text-current-smoke-refresh-20260607.json`
- Current cross-family smoke objective now reports `missing_required_family_keys=['mimo_v2']` instead of `['mimo_v2', 'zaya_text']`.
- Validation passed: objective digest suite `106 passed`; focused proof-chain slice `420 passed, 73 deselected`.
- Aggregate suite remains open with failed steps `packaged_integrity_contracts`, `release_regression_manifest`, `release_gate_skip_app`. No commit, push, signing, notarization, tag, or public release was performed.

## 2026-06-07 - Codex packaged integrity current-drift refresh
- Fixed stale objective digest default in `panel/scripts/release-gate-python-app.py` from `after-mllm-tight-memory-guard` to `build/current-objective-proof-after-zaya-text-current-smoke-refresh-20260607.json`.
- Regenerated packaged-integrity artifact `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-after-staged-sequoia-rebuild-current-source-20260607.json`.
- Release-gate unit tests now pass inside packaged-integrity (`47 passed`); packaged integrity remains red for bundled Python source drift (`server.py` source hash differs from bundled hash) and open objective requirements.
- Refreshed release manifest/checklist to `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-packaged-integrity-current-drift-refresh-20260607.json` and `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-packaged-integrity-current-drift-refresh-20260607.json`.
- Focused validation passed: `370 passed, 115 deselected`.
- No rebundle, re-sign, notarization, tag, push, or public release was performed.

## 2026-06-07 - Codex staged Sequoia rebuild and package integrity pass
- Rebuilt bundled Python from current vMLX source and local JANG tools. `npm run verify-bundled` passed, including vMLX/JANG source parity, TurboQuant kernels, MiMo, Step3p7, Gemma4 unified, VL/audio dependencies, and critical imports.
- Rebuilt `panel/release/sequoia-app/mac-arm64/vMLX.app` with electron-builder dir output. App signing completed; notarization was skipped. No DMG was created.
- New package artifact `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-after-staged-sequoia-rebuild-current-source-20260607.json` -> `status=pass`, `failed=[]`.
- Refreshed manifest/checklist/current suite: `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-zaya-vl-bundled-tool-pass-20260607.json`, `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-packaged-integrity-pass-20260607.json`, `build/current-regression-suite-after-packaged-integrity-pass-20260607.json`.
- Aggregate current suite now has failed steps only `release_regression_manifest`; package/hash/staged-app drift is closed.
- Focused validation passed: `370 passed, 115 deselected`.
- Release remains locked on model/objective blockers. No push, tag, notarization, DMG publication, or website/download update.

2026-06-07: Added explicit full-release checklist coverage for OpenAI Chat
Completions and legacy Completions API/cache rows alongside the existing
Responses/cache-reuse/output-context rows. Recorded that current no-heavy
API/cache/Responses contract is pass but live per-family API/UI/cache E2E remains
release-blocking.

2026-06-07: Reran ZAYA-VL MXFP4 smoke with bundled Python. It replaced a
non-bundled evidence gap with a real bundled-runtime blocker: valid structured
tool call but wrong `record_fact` argument (`argument` vs `blue-cat`) and failed
tool-result continuation (`{"ok":true,"stored":"blue-cat"}` instead of
`STORED blue-cat`). Cache hit telemetry was present. Updated manifest/checklist
pointers to `after-zaya-vl-bundled-tool-failure` artifacts.

2026-06-07: Fixed ZAYA/Zyphra fallback extraction for `value argument must be
the literal string "blue-cat"` and improved ZAYA-VL tool-history coercion. Focused
pytest slice passed. Source ZAYA-VL smoke improved: required tool now emits
`{"value":"blue-cat"}`, but tool-result continuation still fails exact final
answer by returning structured JSON `{"entity_status":"STORED","entity_value":"blue-cat"}`.
Release remains blocked; bundled Python was not rebuilt.

2026-06-07: ZAYA-VL source smoke now passes after merging adjacent synthetic user
turns and rendering stored tool results as `STORED <value>`. Focused pytest slice
3 passed. Refreshed manifest/checklist to `after-zaya-vl-source-tool-pass`; gate
still red because this is source evidence, not bundled Python, and broader MiMo /
Step3p7 / MiniMax / DSV4 / real-UI blockers remain.

2026-06-07: Refreshed bundled Python with current source and local jang-tools.
Bundle verification passed. ZAYA-VL MXFP4 bundled smoke now passes at
`build/current-all-local-model-smoke-zaya-vl-mxfp4-bundled-after-source-tool-pass-20260607/summary.json`.
Manifest/checklist refreshed to `after-zaya-vl-bundled-tool-pass`; release still
blocked by Gemma4/MiniMax/Qwen non-bundled smoke rows plus MiMo, Step3p7,
MiniMax #179, real UI matrix, and DSV4 blockers.

2026-06-07 - MiniMax bundled tool/cache repro and harness HTTP capture
- Patched `bench/all_local_model_smoke.py` to preserve request exceptions in request records/failures, then to handle `urllib.error.HTTPError` as real HTTP status/body instead of code `0`, and to include `response_detail` in summary request records.
- Reran bundled MiniMax smoke three times to separate harness/transport from model/runtime behavior:
  - `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-minimaxk-bundled-after-code0-error-capture-20260607`
  - `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-minimaxk-bundled-after-http400-body-capture-20260607`
  - `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-minimaxk-bundled-after-http400-detail-capture-20260607`
- Final classification: MiniMax `tool_required` is a real HTTP 400 required-tool noncompliance caused by raw `<minimax:tool_call>` markup and zero parsed tool calls. Cache reuse and L2/TurboQuant telemetry are present in the same run; JSON/code/tool-result continuation rows pass.
- Syntax validation: `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile bench/all_local_model_smoke.py` passed.

2026-06-07 - Release manifest pointer update after MiniMax K required-tool repro
- Replaced stale MiniMax K source/non-bundled pointer with `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-minimaxk-bundled-after-http400-detail-capture-20260607/summary.json` in manifest/objective scaffolding.
- Removed MiniMax K from covered live/tool smoke maps because current bundled required-tool proof is red; kept artifact in manifest notes as blocker evidence.
- Updated focused tests so current non-MiMo matrix remains open rather than pretending the failing MiniMax/DSV4 surface is pass.
- Generated `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-minimaxk-http400-detail-20260607.json`: fail, prepackage false, release false.
- Focused tests passed for the changed pointer/open-state rows; full release remains locked.

2026-06-07 - MiniMax K required-tool/parser/cache smoke fixed and bundled
- Implemented strict MiniMax-native tool support improvements: concrete fallback scaffold, bounded lenient parser for recoverable native blocks, no-fake guard for dangling parameter prefixes, required-tool `raw_preview` in HTTP 400 bodies, and MiniMax-specific 256-token required-tool smoke budget.
- Direct source probe proved the root cause: 96-token smoke budget yielded only `<minimax:tool_call>`, while 256 tokens produced a real parsed `record_fact({"value":"blue-cat"})` at 120 completion tokens.
- Source smoke passed: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-minimaxk-source-after-required-tool-256-20260607/summary.json`.
- Rebuilt bundled Python via `panel/scripts/bundle-python.sh` without packaging/signing/notarization; bundle verification passed.
- Bundled smoke passed: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-minimaxk-bundled-after-required-tool-256-20260607/summary.json` with required tool, paged+tq cache hit, block-disk evidence, tool-result continuation, JSON exact, and code exact all green.
- Updated release manifest/objective pointers to current bundled MiniMax pass. Regenerated manifest remains fail/release false for real remaining blockers.

## 2026-06-07 local - Qwen27 JANG_4M-MTP bundled tools/media/cache gate

- Scope stayed in active Python engine worktree; no deprecated wrapper, Swift,
  ADLab/TB/RDMA work, package, signing, notarization, tag, upload, or public
  release action.
- Ran bundled tools/media smoke:
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-qwen36-27b-jang4m-mtp-bundled-tools-media-20260607/summary.json`,
  `status=pass`, `failed=0`.
- Bundled launch proof: `start.json` command uses
  `panel/bundled-python/python/bin/python3.12`, `--is-mllm`, paged cache,
  block disk cache, SSM state cache, `--default-enable-thinking false`, and the
  model path `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ/Qwen3.6-27B-JANG_4M-MTP`.
- Rows passed: text cache `ACK`, cached repeat `cached_tokens=56` with
  `cache_detail=paged+ssm`, multiturn `blue cat`, reasoning-on `FINAL=OK`,
  required tool `record_fact({"value":"blue-cat"})`, tool-result continuation
  `STORED blue-cat`, strict JSON, exact code/whitespace, `vl_blue_image`,
  `text_no_media_after_image`, `vl_blue_image_repeat`, `vl_red_image_changed`,
  `vl_blue_video`, and `text_no_media_after_video`.
- Cache/runtime proof: L2 block tokens on disk `673`, L2 SSM tokens on disk
  `993`, q4 attention-KV storage, hybrid SSM typed cache, pixel cache hit, and
  native MTP final depth `3`.
- Manifest live-smoke and live-tool-smoke pointers for `qwen36_moe_crack` now
  target this bundled tools/media artifact instead of the filtered no-media
  artifact.

## 2026-06-07 local - post-Qwen manifest/objective refresh

- Focused manifest tests passed:
  `tests/test_release_regression_manifest.py::test_release_regression_manifest_tracks_covered_live_smoke_artifacts`,
  `...rejects_missing_or_failing_covered_live_smoke_artifacts`,
  `...rejects_live_smoke_missing_required_request_coverage`,
  `...rejects_live_smoke_wrong_capability_family`,
  and `...rejects_live_tool_smoke_without_repeat_cache_hit`.
- Refreshed row manifest:
  `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-qwen36-bundled-media-pass-20260607.json`.
- Refreshed proof sweep validation:
  `build/current-proof-sweep-validation-after-qwen36-bundled-media-pass-20260607.json`,
  `status=fail`; Qwen is cleared from live-smoke/live-tool-smoke not-pass rows;
  Gemma4 remains not-pass because its current proof uses non-bundled Python.
- Refreshed objective checklist:
  `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-qwen36-bundled-media-pass-20260607.json`,
  still `OPEN` on cross-family/cache/parser/media/UI/MiMo/MiniMax/DSV4 quality
  gates. No signing, notarization, tag, upload, or release action was taken.

## 2026-06-07 local - API/cache/Responses endpoint contract refresh

- Ran no-heavy endpoint/cache contract:
  `build/current-noheavy-api-cache-contract-after-qwen36-bundled-media-pass-20260607.json`.
- Result: `status=pass`, `missing_markers=[]`.
- Counts: API route contracts `40 passed`, scheduler cache contracts `8 passed`,
  TQ/MLLM cache contracts `32 passed`, DSV4 DSML tool contracts `21 passed`,
  Responses history contracts `3 passed`.
- Manifest/objective pointers now target this artifact instead of
  `build/current-noheavy-api-cache-contract-after-jangtq2-objective-refresh-20260607.json`.

## 2026-06-07 local - objective pointer sync after Qwen/API-cache refresh

- Synced `tests/cross_matrix/run_current_regression_suite.py` release manifest
  command to `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-qwen36-bundled-media-api-cache-pass-20260607.json`.
- Synced `tests/cross_matrix/summarize_objective_proof.py` to the same release
  manifest artifact and to the current ZAYA-VL bundled proof
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-zaya-vl-mxfp4-bundled-after-source-tool-pass-20260607/summary.json`.

## 2026-06-07 local - final pointer-sync artifacts for Qwen/API-cache slice

- Regenerated:
  `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-qwen36-bundled-media-api-cache-pointer-sync-20260607.json`.
- Regenerated:
  `build/current-proof-sweep-validation-after-qwen36-bundled-media-api-cache-pointer-sync-20260607.json`,
  `status=fail`, with Gemma4 `command_python_not_bundled` as the remaining
  live-smoke/live-tool-smoke not-pass row.
- Regenerated:
  `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-qwen36-bundled-media-api-cache-pointer-sync-20260607.json`.
- Tests passed:
  `tests/test_release_regression_manifest.py` focused Qwen live-smoke/tool-smoke
  slice: `5 passed`.
- Tests passed:
  `tests/test_objective_proof_digest.py` focused API-cache/objective pointer
  slice: `4 passed`.

## 2026-06-07 local - Gemma4 26B bundled tools/media/cache gate

- Ran bundled tools/media smoke:
  `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma26-jang4m-bundled-tools-media-20260607/summary.json`,
  `status=pass`, `failed=0`.
- Bundled launch proof: `start.json` command uses
  `panel/bundled-python/python/bin/python3.12`, `--is-mllm`, paged cache,
  block disk cache, `--default-enable-thinking false`, and the model path
  `/Users/eric/models/dealign.ai/Gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-JANG_4M-CRACK`.
- Rows passed: text cache `ACK`, cached repeat `cached_tokens=56` with
  `cache_detail=paged+mixed_swa`, multiturn `blue cat`, reasoning-on
  `FINAL=OK`, required tool `record_fact({"value":"blue-cat"})`, tool-result
  continuation `STORED blue-cat`, strict JSON, exact code/whitespace,
  `vl_blue_image`, `text_no_media_after_image`, `vl_blue_image_repeat`,
  `vl_red_image_changed`, `vl_blue_video`, and `text_no_media_after_video`.
- Cache/runtime proof: L2 block tokens on disk `612`, q4 mixed SWA/full KV
  storage-boundary quantization, rotating-window metadata preservation, pixel
  cache hit, and no generic TurboQuant KV on Gemma4 mixed-SWA cache.
- Manifest live-smoke and live-tool-smoke pointers for `gemma4_crack` now target
  this bundled artifact instead of the non-bundled 20260606 artifact.

## 2026-06-07 local - live-smoke/live-tool-smoke sweep green

- Focused tests passed after Gemma4/Nemotron cache-family correction:
  `tests/test_release_regression_manifest.py` live-smoke/tool-smoke slice and
  `tests/test_objective_proof_digest.py::test_objective_proof_digest_live_smoke_pointers_match_release_manifest_current_map`.
- Proof sweep artifact:
  `build/current-proof-sweep-validation-after-gemma4-nemotron-cache-family-fix-20260607.json`.
- Result: `live_smoke_status=pass`, `live_tool_smoke_status=pass`, both
  `not_pass=[]`.

## 2026-06-07 local - no-heavy contract refresh after live-smoke green

- Tool-call/maxToolIterations contract passed: `engine_dsv4_dsml_tool_contracts=22`,
  `panel_tool_loop_security=78`, `engine_family_tool_parser_matrix=144`.
- Max output/context contract passed: `engine_output_context_resolution=26`,
  `panel_output_context_wiring=54`.

- Native MTP contract passed: engine `127`, panel controls `16`, panel detection `8`.
- VL media/cache contract passed: engine `45`, panel follow-up `13`, VLM settings `12`, family detection `14`.

## 2026-06-07 local - current MiMo V2.5 JANGTQ_2 bundled proof still red

- Ran bundled no-media tools/cache smoke with no source-vs-quant comparison:

## 2026-06-07 local - MiMo tokenizer roundtrip isolation

- Ran bundled tokenizer roundtrip with `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(...,
  local_files_only=True)` on `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/MiMo-V2.5-JANGTQ_2`.
- Exact roundtrip passed for `blue-cat`, `B7-CAT-09`, `blue-123`, `B7CAT-09`,
  and `B7CCAT-09`.
- Classification strengthened: current MiMo exact tool/JSON mutations are not
  explained by tokenizer decode losing hyphens or changing strings.

## 2026-06-07 local - MiMo capability truth and current release gate refresh

- Bundled Python rebuild completed from current source and local JANG tools before rerun.
- Added MiMo capability truth in source and bundled runtime: MiMo V2.5 is not advertised as thinking-capable; `think_xml` no-tag behavior no longer hides visible text; XML tools remain enabled.
- Updated smoke harness so MiMo no-media proof does not run a false reasoning probe and reports normalized capability metadata.
- Ran MiMo bundled no-media tools/cache smoke: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-mimo-v25-jangtq2-bundled-tools-nomedia-after-mimo-capability-snapshot-fix-20260607/summary.json` -> `probe_failed`, `failures=4`.
- Passed runtime/cache surface in that proof: paged cache reuse, cache hit telemetry, multiturn recall, parsed XML tool call shape, tool-result continuation, exact code/whitespace, no visible/hidden reasoning split error under no-thinking policy.
- Failed exactness rows remain: tool `blue-cat -> blue-123`, sentinel tool `B7-CAT-09 -> B7CAT-09`, JSON `blue-cat -> blue-1`, sentinel JSON `B7-CAT-09 -> B7CCAT-09`.
- Updated objective pointers to latest MiMo artifact and regenerated release/objective/checklist artifacts:
  - `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-mimo-capability-snapshot-fix-20260607.json`
  - `build/current-objective-proof-after-mimo-capability-snapshot-fix-20260607.json`
  - `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-mimo-capability-snapshot-fix-20260607.json`
- Focused validation passed: objective digest selector `11 passed`; release-manifest live smoke/tool smoke selector `32 passed`.
- Full checklist remains `status=open`, `failed_count=18`; blockers include MiMo exactness/long/CB/source/media, Step3p7 real VLM proof, MiniMax #179 reporter parity/root cause, real UI matrix, and DSV4 memory/exactness/code rows.

## 2026-06-07 local - proof-chain source-hash refresh after MiMo capability truth

- Found objective rows still open because old no-heavy artifacts had stale source hashes after the MiMo capability/registry/decode-speed changes.
- Fixed `tests/cross_matrix/run_decode_speed_gate.py` so `mimo_v25_jang2l` no longer declares `reasoning_parser=think_xml`; XML tools remain enabled.
- Reran current-source no-heavy contracts: cache architecture, model family detection, parser registry, model artifact format, generation defaults, native MTP, and VL/media cache. All passed.
- Regenerated release/objective/checklist artifacts under `after-current-source-contract-refresh-20260607` names.
- Objective digest now shows PASS for cache architecture, high-risk model family/parser/artifact gates, and generation/native-MTP/VL-media gates.
- Validation passed: objective digest selector `15 passed`; release-manifest selector `47 passed`.
- Release remains blocked by live/model/UI blockers only: MiMo, Step3p7 live VLM, MiniMax #179, real Electron UI matrix, and DSV4 memory/exactness/code rows.

## 2026-06-07 local - Step3p7 source VLM live proof and API/cache release rows

- Fixed Step3p7 MLLM detection in `vmlx_engine/api/utils.py`: advertised Step3p7 VLM metadata now routes to MLLM only when the source-owned `vmlx_engine.models.step3p7_mlx_vlm` runtime surface is available; missing runtime still blocks forced MLLM and stays text-only.
- Ran source live Step3p7 smoke: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-step37-jang2l-source-tools-media-after-vlm-routing-20260607/summary.json` -> `status=pass`, `failed=0`.
- Live proof covered text cache repeat, paged+mixed_swa cache reuse (`cached_tokens=61`), tool call, tool-result continuation, reasoning-on visible answer, exact JSON, exact code, image blue/repeat/red-change, video request path, and no-media text recovery after image/video.
- Generated Step3p7 VLM audit: `build/current-step37-vlm-runtime-audit-after-source-live-media-proof-20260607.json` -> `status=pass`, `release_clearance=audit_does_not_block_release`, `live_media_proof.pass=true`.
- Made `/v1/responses`, previous_response_id, streaming cache detail usage, cache stats/entries/warm/clear endpoints, and panel single-model cache endpoint autoswitch explicit full-release checklist rows through the API-surface contract.
- Regenerated current release artifacts:
  - `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-step37-live-vlm-proof-20260607.json` -> release still open.
  - `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-step37-live-vlm-proof-20260607.json` -> `status=open`, `failed_count=17`.
  - `build/current-objective-proof-after-step37-live-vlm-proof-20260607.json` -> 20 PASS, 6 OPEN.
- Focused validation passed: Step3p7/API/checklist/manifest pointer slice `37 passed`; py_compile passed for touched runners/tests.
- Release remains blocked by: MiMo exactness/long/CB/source/media rows, MiniMax #179 reporter parity/root cause, real Electron UI live matrix, DSV4 memory/exactness/code/file-generation rows, and packaging/release state. No signing/notarization/tag/download update performed.

## 2026-06-07 local - MiMo KV-none/no-prefix exactness isolation and cache/Responses status

- Added `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-mimo-v25-jangtq2-bundled-tools-nomedia-kvnone-noprefix-20260607/summary.json` to the MiMo current audit.
- Regenerated `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-current-audit-after-kvnone-noprefix-exactness-isolation-20260607.json`.
- Result: MiMo remains `status=open`, `local_release_clearance=false`.
- Cache/Responses endpoint contract is green via `build/current-noheavy-api-cache-contract-after-qwen36-bundled-media-pass-20260607.json`.
- MiMo cache proof distinction: the same literal exactness failures reproduce with runtime KV quantization disabled, native storage quantization disabled, prefix cache disabled, paged cache disabled, block-disk L2 disabled, and zero cache hits.
- Therefore do not chase prefix cache reuse, paged/L2 disk cache, or runtime KV quantization as the primary current MiMo exactness cause.
- Current MiMo blockers remain: long-prompt coherence, JANGTQ2 artifact literal exactness, CB system-prompt working-set pressure, source-vs-quant/equivalent classification, VL/audio/video unwired, and media runtime implementation missing.
- Refreshed current artifacts:
  - `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-mimo-kvnone-isolation-20260607.json`
  - `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-mimo-kvnone-isolation-20260607.json`
  - `build/current-objective-proof-after-mimo-kvnone-isolation-20260607.json`
- Current checklist remains red: `failed_count=17`.
- Current objective proof remains `20 PASS / 6 OPEN`.
- Narrow validation passed: release-gate objective pointer, API cache pointer, MiMo current audit tests, objective pointer, and full checklist tests (`9 passed`).
- Broader selected pytest still exposes unrelated stale release-manifest expectations; do not treat release as clear until those are fixed or explicitly scoped out.

## 2026-06-07 local - Release execution tracker and AGENTS current gate snapshot

- Updated `AGENTS.md` with a current 2026-06-07 gate snapshot pointing to:
  - `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-mimo-kvnone-isolation-20260607.json`
  - `build/current-objective-proof-after-mimo-kvnone-isolation-20260607.json`
  - `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-mimo-kvnone-isolation-20260607.json`
  - `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-current-audit-after-kvnone-noprefix-exactness-isolation-20260607.json`
  - `build/current-noheavy-api-cache-contract-after-qwen36-bundled-media-pass-20260607.json`
- Added durable tracker `docs/internal/VMLX_MLXSTUDIO_RELEASE_EXECUTION_TRACKER_2026_06_07.md`.
- Tracker keeps release status red, lists 6 open objective rows, itemizes MiMo blockers, preserves the cache/Responses distinction, and lists per-family cache/tool/media/UI/release requirements.
- Release lock remains active: no signing, notarization, tag, appcast/download update, or public release while objective rows remain open.

## 2026-06-07 local - MiniMax #179 memory-preflight classification refresh

- Selected next open objective row: `MiniMax-M2.7-JANGTQ_K reporter parity/root cause is release-cleared`.
- Ran missing local reporter-prompt reproduction command through the existing MiniMax Responses cancel probe harness:
  - `build/current-issue179-minimax-k-responses-cancel-probe-installed-badtext-20260528.json`
  - result: `status=skipped`, `reason=insufficient_vm_stat_memory`; no unsafe bypass of memory guard was performed.
- Refreshed root-cause audit:
  - `build/current-issue179-minimax-k-root-cause-audit-after-local-repro-memory-preflight-20260607.json`
  - result: `status=open`.
- Current issue179 classification:
  - local Responses cancel probe remains green.
  - local reporter-prompt reproduction artifact now exists but is memory-preflight skipped, not clean.
  - reporter parity artifact is still missing.
  - reporter server hash still drifts from current source/local/latest public bundle.
  - reporter log/session/cancel lifecycle proof is still missing.
- Refreshed current release artifacts:
  - `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-issue179-memory-preflight-20260607.json`
  - `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-issue179-memory-preflight-20260607.json`
  - `build/current-objective-proof-after-issue179-memory-preflight-20260607.json`
  - `build/current-public-app-issue-audit-after-issue179-memory-preflight-20260607.json`
  - `build/current-issue175-179-release-boundary-audit-after-issue179-memory-preflight-20260607.json`
- Current release remains red: full checklist `failed_count=17`, objective proof 20 PASS / 6 OPEN.

## 2026-06-07 local - Real UI LFM25 refresh

- Selected next open objective row: real Electron UI live model matrix.
- Ran current Electron dev real UI proof for LFM2.5 MXFP4 with Responses, builtin tools, cache controls, and max output 256:
  - proof: `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-lfm25-mxfp4-responses-tools-cachecontrols-20260607-proof.json`
  - screenshot: `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-lfm25-mxfp4-responses-tools-cachecontrols-20260607-chat.png`
- Proof status: `pass`.
- Covered surfaces include: `responses_api`, `responses_delta_streaming`, `long_tool_loop`, `tool_l2_cache_integrated`, `cache_hit_telemetry`, `native_cache_status`, `server_cache_controls`, `l2_disk_storage`, `settings_persistence`, parser/language leak checks, and live speed floor.
- Runtime/cache proof: LFM native cache is `family=lfm2`, `schema=hybrid_ssm_v1`, `cache_type=hybrid_ssm_typed`, components include `attention_kv`, `ssm_companion_state`, and `async_rederive`; generic TurboQuant KV is disabled for `hybrid_ssm_state`; attention KV storage-boundary q4 is active; prefix/paged/block-disk L2 are true; cache hit tokens observed `2759`; L2 block tokens `1559`; L2 SSM tokens `4631`.
- Updated LFM real UI proof pointers so the matrix no longer mixes stale JANG_2L and current MXFP4 identities.
- Refreshed current artifacts:
  - `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-real-ui-qwen-mtp-toolblock-20260607.json`
  - `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-real-ui-qwen-mtp-toolblock-20260607.json`
  - `build/current-objective-proof-after-mimo-manifest-classifier-sync-20260607.json`
- Current UI matrix classification: LFM family is now pass; covered non-DSV4 families are pass, but aggregate `real_ui_live_model_proof` still fails on stale individual proof identity checks and DSV4 remains missing/memory-gated. Full UI release row remains open.

## CODEX 2026-06-07 Qwen MTP real UI cache/Responses proof refresh
- now: replaced stale Qwen3.6 MXFP4 real-UI proof pointers with current `Qwen3.6-27B-JANG_4M-MTP` evidence.
- proof: `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-qwen36-27b-jang4m-mtp-responses-tools-cachecontrols-deterministic-mtp-20260607-proof.json`.
- result: `status=fail`, `failureStage=release_assertions`, `assertionFailures=[requested real built-in tools but proof did not record long_tool_loop surface]`.
- green subproofs: current model identity, Responses API, Responses delta streaming, cache detail usage, cache-hit telemetry, native hybrid SSM cache status, TurboQuant attention KV storage, block-disk L2, SSM companion L2, server cache controls, settings persistence, parser/language leak checks.
- tool diagnosis: UI persisted tool events and executed the requested files, but the first tool call used malformed empty args (`run_command {}`) before recovery, so the proof correctly does not record `long_tool_loop`.
- harness fix: `panel/scripts/live-real-ui-model-proof.mjs` now writes release assertion failures back into the proof JSON before throwing, preventing failed proofs from being serialized as `status=pass`.
- refreshed artifacts: `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-real-ui-qwen-mtp-toolblock-20260607.json`, `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-real-ui-qwen-mtp-toolblock-20260607.json`, and `build/current-objective-proof-after-mimo-manifest-classifier-sync-20260607.json`.
- release boundary: cache/Responses endpoints are not enough for release; Qwen MTP long tool-loop, current image/video/reasoning UI coverage, MiMo, MiniMax #179, DSV4, and full installed UI matrix remain open. No signing/notarization/tag/release was done.

## CODEX 2026-06-07 Qwen MTP real UI tools/cache/MTP pass
- now: fixed the Qwen 3.6 JANG_4M-MTP real-UI tool-loop blocker without masking tool errors.
- runtime changes:
  - `vmlx_engine/api/tool_calling.py` strengthens Qwen native fallback instructions when the user explicitly names an available tool: emit the native tool call first, do not fabricate a result, do not emit empty calls, and include non-empty required params.
  - `vmlx_engine/server.py` drops parsed tool calls whose request-tool schema has missing/empty required arguments, so malformed `<function=run_command>` no longer becomes executable `{}`.
  - `panel/scripts/live-real-ui-model-proof.mjs` records release assertion failures into proof JSON before throwing and supports explicit sampling overrides for deterministic native-MTP UI proofs.
- proof: `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-qwen36-27b-jang4m-mtp-responses-tools-cachecontrols-deterministic-mtp-20260607-proof.json`.
- result: `status=pass`.
- proven: current model identity, Responses API, Responses delta streaming, cache detail usage, built-in `run_command` tool loop, settings persistence, deterministic UI sampling overrides (`temperature=0`, `repeatPenalty=1`), native MTP activation under tool-compatible D1, hybrid SSM typed cache, TurboQuant attention KV, block-disk L2, SSM companion L2, server cache controls, parser/language leak checks.
- evidence highlights: `last_native_mtp.fallback_reason=null`, accepted 8/14 in last turn; `cacheHitTokens=23225`; L2 totals show block tokens 4555 and SSM tokens 23225.
- release boundary: this clears the Qwen27 real-UI Responses/tools/cache/MTP slice only. Qwen media/reasoning UI, Qwen35, MiMo, MiniMax #179, DSV4, installed-app matrix, signing, notarization, tagging, and public release remain open.

## CODEX 2026-06-07 release gate refresh after Qwen MTP UI pass
- refreshed no-heavy contracts after source edits: tool-call, max-output/context, cache architecture, model-family detection, parser registry, model-artifact format, generation defaults/local metadata, native MTP, VL media cache, and no-heavy API/cache all pass current-source checks.
- Step3p7 metadata audit updated to record current source behavior: advertised Step3p7 vision routes MLLM by default when source runtime is available, instead of stale text-only guard expectation.
- release manifest refreshed: `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-real-ui-qwen-mtp-toolblock-20260607.json` remains `prepackage_ready=false`, `release_ready=false`.
- full checklist refreshed: `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-real-ui-qwen-mtp-toolblock-20260607.json` remains `status=open`, `failed_count=17`; `real_ui_live_model_proof=true`, `real_ui_full_model_matrix=false`.
- objective proof refreshed: `build/current-objective-proof-after-mimo-manifest-classifier-sync-20260607.json` is 20 PASS / 6 OPEN.
- validation: node syntax + Python py_compile passed; focused release gate slice `9 passed`; engine tool slice previously `61 passed`; local generation metadata `5 passed`.
- release boundary: no signing, notarization, tagging, push, package release, or public download update. Remaining blockers are MiMo quality/media, MiniMax #179 reporter/root cause, DSV4 memory/exact long-output, cross-family live multi-turn matrix, and full installed UI/media matrix.

## CODEX 2026-06-07 Qwen35/cache/Responses release-gate refresh
- selected blocker class: `api/ui` plus `cache/storage`; reduced real-UI Qwen MTP coverage and refreshed generated release gates.
- Qwen35 proof in scope: `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-qwen36-35b-mxfp8-mtp-responses-tools-cachecontrols-deterministic-mtp-20260607-proof.json` with screenshot `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-qwen36-35b-mxfp8-mtp-responses-tools-cachecontrols-deterministic-mtp-20260607-chat.png`.
- Qwen35 result: `status=pass`; real UI Responses streaming, built-in tool loop, cache detail usage, deterministic recorded sampling, native MTP active under tool-compatible D1, hybrid SSM cache, TurboQuant attention KV, block-disk L2, SSM companion L2, server cache controls, settings persistence, and parser/language leak checks are proven.
- regenerated release gates: `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-real-ui-qwen-mtp-toolblock-20260607.json`, `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-real-ui-qwen-mtp-toolblock-20260607.json`, `build/current-objective-proof-after-mimo-manifest-classifier-sync-20260607.json`.
- generated state remains red: manifest `prepackage_ready=false` and `release_ready=false`; checklist `status=open`, `failed_count=17`; objective proof 20 PASS / 6 OPEN.
- cache reuse/Responses endpoints are green only as no-heavy/API contract proof; full per-family live E2E for cache/restart/cancel/media/UI remains required before release.
- no signing, notarization, tag, release, public download update, or push-to-main claim was performed.

## 2026-06-07 local - Gemma4 12B JANG_4M Responses/tools/image/cache proof

- Ran current Electron dev real UI proof for `JANGQ-AI/gemma-4-12B-it-JANG_4M` with Responses, built-in tools, image, cache controls, deterministic sampling, and default optimized server flags.
- Proof passed:
  - `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-gemma4-12b-jang4m-responses-tools-image-cachecontrols-after-media-fallback-20260607-proof.json`
  - `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-gemma4-12b-jang4m-responses-tools-image-cachecontrols-after-media-fallback-20260607-chat.png`
- Runtime evidence: server health `engine_type=batched`; text/tool turns used Gemma4 native `mixed_swa_kv_v1`, `paged+mixed_swa`, `cache_hit_tokens=8354`, block-disk L2 writes, and `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=3016`.
- Media evidence: image turn returned `Red` and server log recorded `Using simple MLLM media streaming fallback for gemma4 with 1 image(s), 0 video(s)`.
- Classification: model artifact/upload is not the source of the Gemma4 image corruption. The bug was the optimized batched Gemma4 media prefill/output path; current source routes Gemma4 media through a scoped simple MLLM fallback while leaving text/tool cache on the optimized batched path.
- Regenerated gates after the proof: release manifest remains `prepackage_ready=false`, `release_ready=false`; full checklist remains `status=open`, `failed_count=17`; objective proof remains 20 PASS / 6 OPEN.
- Boundary: this does not claim full Gemma4 release clearance. MXFP4/MXFP8 media UI, audio/video, installed-app parity, optimized batched media-cache parity, full matrix, signing, notarization, tagging, and public release remain blocked.

## 2026-06-07 local - AGENTS release loop and MiMo current audit refresh

- Hardened `AGENTS.md` with a mandatory continuation loop: stay in the active Python/Electron worktree, name the blocker, prefer live proofs, update status/log/tracker, regenerate gates only when meaningful, and do not sign/notarize/tag/publish while objective rows are open.
- Added a concrete minimum evidence standard for "working": visible output, multi-turn, required/auto/no-tool/tool-result behavior, raw leak checks, JSON/XML/code/whitespace exactness, cache miss/hit telemetry, typed native cache, L2 restart restore, largest-context tail inspection, UI settings reflection, and installed-app parity before release.
- Refreshed no-heavy MiMo current-artifact audit without source-vs-quant load:
  - `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-current-audit-after-agents-release-loop-20260607.json`
- MiMo remains `status=open`, `local_release_clearance=false`.
- Current MiMo green subproofs: manifest integrity, stale local state absent, structural verify, SwitchGLU selected-expert parity, text cache narrow proof, cache-vs-nocache next-token parity, OpenAI tool structure, prefix/paged/L2 cache reproved, decode speed target near 40 tok/s, no-heavy API/cache/Responses contract, and exactness not caused by prefix/paged/L2/KV quantization.
- Current MiMo blockers: literal exactness still mutates values (`blue-cat`, `B7-CAT-09`), long-prompt coherence remains blocked, CB system-prompt working-set pressure remains blocked, source-vs-quant/equivalent artifact classification remains unresolved under current RAM constraint, and MiMo VL/audio/video is preserved but unwired.
- Updated full-objective checklist pointer so future generated gates consume the refreshed MiMo audit.

## 2026-06-07 local - Qwen27 MTP media/reasoning UI proof

- Ran current Electron dev real UI proof for `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ/Qwen3.6-27B-JANG_4M-MTP` with Responses, built-in tools, reasoning enabled, image input, cache controls, deterministic sampling, and MTP.
- First run at `max_tokens=96` failed release assertions:
  - `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-qwen36-27b-jang4m-mtp-responses-tools-image-reasoning-cachecontrols-20260607-proof.json`
  - The image answer was semantically correct (`Red.`) and `vl_image` was proven, but turn 2 used the budget on reasoning-only output and missed visible/tool-loop completion.
- Reran at `max_tokens=256`; proof passed:
  - `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-qwen36-27b-jang4m-mtp-responses-tools-image-reasoning-cachecontrols-max256-20260607-proof.json`
  - `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-qwen36-27b-jang4m-mtp-responses-tools-image-reasoning-cachecontrols-max256-20260607-chat.png`
- Proven surfaces: `long_tool_loop`, `reasoning_display`, `vl_image`, `tool_l2_cache_integrated`, Responses streaming/cache detail, native cache, block L2, SSM L2, server cache controls, settings persistence, parser/language leak checks.
- Runtime/cache evidence: native MTP active for text+VL, D3 configured but capped to D1 when tools are present, `hybrid_ssm_v1`, TurboQuant attention KV for attention layers only, SSM companion native/full precision, block-disk L2 tokens, SSM companion L2 tokens, and media-safe skip of media prompt cache store.
- Updated release manifest Qwen27 reasoning/image row to use the max-256 passing proof.
- Boundary: this clears Qwen27 dev-Electron tools+image+reasoning+cache slice only. Qwen35 media/reasoning, Qwen video, installed-app parity, largest-context/restart matrix, and release remain open.
- Regenerated gates after pointer update: release manifest remains `prepackage_ready=false`, `release_ready=false`; full checklist remains `status=open`, `failed_count=17`; objective proof remains 20 PASS / 6 OPEN.

## 2026-06-07 local - Qwen35 MTP media/reasoning UI proof

- Ran current Electron dev real UI proof for `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-MXFP8-MTP` with Responses, built-in tools, reasoning enabled, image input, cache controls, deterministic sampling, and MTP.
- Proof passed:
  - `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-qwen36-35b-mxfp8-mtp-responses-tools-image-reasoning-cachecontrols-max256-20260607-proof.json`
  - `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-qwen36-35b-mxfp8-mtp-responses-tools-image-reasoning-cachecontrols-max256-20260607-chat.png`
- Proven surfaces: `long_tool_loop`, `reasoning_display`, `vl_image`, `tool_l2_cache_integrated`, Responses streaming/cache detail, native cache, block L2, SSM L2, server cache controls, settings persistence, parser/language leak checks.
- Runtime/cache evidence: native MTP active for text+VL, D3 configured but capped to D1 when tools are present, no `gdn_sink` crash, trained active experts 8, `hybrid_ssm_v1`, TurboQuant attention KV for attention layers only, SSM companion native/full precision, block-disk L2 tokens, SSM companion L2 tokens, and media-safe skip of media prompt cache store.
- Added release manifest Qwen35 reasoning/image row pointing at the max-256 passing proof.
- Boundary: this clears Qwen35 dev-Electron tools+image+reasoning+cache slice only. Qwen video, installed-app parity, largest-context/restart matrix, and release remain open.
- Regenerated gates after Qwen35 pointer update: release manifest remains `prepackage_ready=false`, `release_ready=false`; full checklist remains `status=open`, `failed_count=17`; objective proof remains 20 PASS / 6 OPEN.

## 2026-06-07 local - Qwen MTP video UI proofs

- Ran current Electron dev video proofs using existing 14 KB red/green/blue MP4 data URLs.
- Qwen27 JANG_4M MTP video proof passed:
  - `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-qwen36-27b-jang4m-mtp-responses-tools-video-reasoning-cachecontrols-max256-20260607-proof.json`
  - `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-qwen36-27b-jang4m-mtp-responses-tools-video-reasoning-cachecontrols-max256-20260607-chat.png`
- Qwen35 MXFP8 MTP video first failed at max-256:
  - `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-qwen36-35b-mxfp8-mtp-responses-tools-video-reasoning-cachecontrols-max256-20260607-proof.json`
  - Frames decoded and runtime stayed healthy, but final video turn ended reasoning-only at length with no visible description.
- Qwen35 MXFP8 MTP video rerun passed at max-512:
  - `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-qwen36-35b-mxfp8-mtp-responses-tools-video-reasoning-cachecontrols-max512-20260607-proof.json`
  - `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-qwen36-35b-mxfp8-mtp-responses-tools-video-reasoning-cachecontrols-max512-20260607-chat.png`
- Proven Qwen video surfaces: `video_where_supported`, `long_tool_loop`, `reasoning_display`, Responses streaming/cache detail, native MTP active for text+VL, typed `hybrid_ssm_v1`, TurboQuant attention KV, block L2, SSM L2, server cache controls, settings persistence, parser/language leak checks.
- Updated release manifest video rows for Qwen27 and Qwen35.
- Boundary: this clears dev-Electron Qwen video slices only. Installed-app parity, largest-context/restart matrix, MiMo, MiniMax #179, DSV4, and release remain open.
- Regenerated gates after Qwen video pointer update: release manifest remains `prepackage_ready=false`, `release_ready=false`; full checklist remains `status=open`, `failed_count=17`; objective proof remains 20 PASS / 6 OPEN.

## 2026-06-07 local - cache reuse/Responses endpoint release boundary tightened

- Recorded installed-app Qwen27 proof after process exit:
  `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-installed-app-qwen36-27b-jang4m-mtp-responses-tools-image-reasoning-cachecontrols-max256-20260607-proof.json`.
- Installed Qwen27 result: `status=pass`; bundled `/Applications/vMLX.app` Python reported `vmlx_engine 1.5.56` and passed Responses streaming, tool loop, reasoning display, image answer, native MTP, hybrid SSM cache, TurboQuant attention KV, block L2, SSM L2, server cache controls, settings persistence, parser/language leak checks, and installed-app UI route.
- Packaged perf risk: installed app proof reported `nax_symbols=0` / `naxtile_symbols=0`; functional slice is green, but packaged acceleration/speed parity is not cleared.
- Tightened the release tracker's cache/Responses section so no-heavy endpoint-contract green cannot be mistaken for release clearance.
- Current no-heavy API/cache/Responses contract remains green:
  `build/current-noheavy-api-cache-contract-after-qwen36-bundled-media-pass-20260607.json`.
- Explicit green plumbing rows include `responses_previous_response_history`, `cache_stats_reuse_skip_telemetry`, `cache_reuse_endpoints`, streaming cache detail usage, JSON schema/text-format preservation, and max output/context separation.
- Boundary: every release-critical family still needs live visible stream/non-stream output, tool-result continuation, cancellation cleanup, typed native cache, first-miss/second-hit cache telemetry, block-disk L2 write, restart/fresh-process restore, largest-context tail inspection, and UI/installed-app parity before release.

## 2026-06-07 local - Qwen35 installed-app image/reasoning/cache proof

- First installed-app Qwen35 attempt used invalid media env `VMLINUX_REAL_UI_CHECK_IMAGE=1`; it passed text/tools/reasoning/cache but did not exercise image media (`requestedMedia=false`). This was not recorded as an image pass.
- Corrected installed-app Qwen35 run used `VMLINUX_REAL_UI_CHECK_MEDIA=1` and passed:
  `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-installed-app-qwen36-35b-mxfp8-mtp-responses-tools-image-reasoning-cachecontrols-max256-20260607-proof.json`.
- Installed Qwen35 result: `status=pass`; bundled `/Applications/vMLX.app` Python reported `vmlx_engine 1.5.56`; image media was actually exercised (`requestedMedia=true`, `num_images_processed=1`, `vl_image`).
- Proven surfaces: Responses streaming/cache detail, built-in tool loop, reasoning display, image answer, native MTP, trained top-k 8, typed `hybrid_ssm_v1`, TurboQuant attention KV for attention layers only, block-disk L2, SSM companion L2, server cache controls, settings persistence, parser/language leak checks, and installed-app UI route.
- Correct media-cache boundary observed: media prompt cache store was skipped as path-dependent rather than reusing a text-only cache entry.
- Speed/perf note: installed Qwen35 live samples were about `83-89 live tok/s`; installed app still reports `nax_symbols=0` / `naxtile_symbols=0`, so packaged acceleration symbol parity remains a release risk even though this functional slice is green.
- Remaining Qwen blockers: installed-app video, largest-context, restart/fresh-process L2 restore, cancellation cleanup matrix, and full installed-app cross-family matrix. No signing/notarization/tag/download update.

## 2026-06-07 local - Qwen27 restart-L2 restore proof recorded

- Inspected current checklist artifact:
  `build/current-qwen27-mxfp4-mtp-restart-l2-restore-20260607/summary.json`.
- Result: `status=pass`.
- Pass conditions: phase 1 ack, phase 2 ack, positive phase 2 cache-hit tokens, phase 2 block disk hit, L2 tokens on disk, native MTP active, and no errors.
- Phase 1 wrote block L2: `total_tokens_on_disk=63`, `disk_writes=1`, typed native cache `hybrid_ssm_v1`, attention-only TurboQuant KV, native SSM companion policy, and native MTP active.
- Phase 2 fresh-process restore hit disk: `cached_tokens=63`, `cache_detail=paged+ssm+disk`, `disk_hits=1`, typed native cache `hybrid_ssm_v1`, and native MTP active.
- Boundary: this clears Qwen27 restart-L2 restore only. Qwen35 restart-L2 restore, Qwen installed-app video, largest-context tail inspection, cancellation cleanup matrix, and full installed-app cross-family matrix remain open.

## 2026-06-07 local - Qwen35 restart-L2 restore proof and checklist wiring

- Ran a controlled bundled-Python Qwen35 restart-L2 proof with two fresh `vmlx_engine.cli serve` processes sharing one block-cache directory.
- Artifact:
  `build/current-qwen35-mxfp8-mtp-restart-l2-restore-20260607/summary.json`.
- Result: `status=pass`; both phases returned visible `ACK-QWEN35-L2`.
- Phase 1 wrote 27 block-L2 entries (`total_tokens_on_disk=1695`) plus SSM companion disk state (`stores=2`, `total_tokens_on_disk=3359`).
- Phase 2 restored from disk: `cached_tokens=1695`, `cache_detail=paged+ssm+disk`, block disk `disk_hits=27`, SSM companion disk `hits=1`, typed native cache `hybrid_ssm_v1`, attention-only TurboQuant KV, and native MTP active at depth 3.
- Wired the proof into the full objective checklist:
  `tests/cross_matrix/run_full_release_objective_checklist.py`.
- Added focused fixture coverage:
  `tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py`.
- Validation passed: py_compile for edited files and focused checklist pytest (`2 passed`).
- Regenerated full checklist:
  `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-qwen35-restart-l2-restore-20260607.json`.
- Generated state remains release-red: `status=open`, `failed_count=17`. Remaining blockers are MiMo exactness/long/CB/source/media, MiniMax #179 reporter parity/root cause, DSV4 memory/exact code-file-long output, full real UI/installed-app matrix, and prepackage/release gates.

## 2026-06-07 local - Qwen installed-app video proofs

- Ran installed-app Qwen27 video with `/Applications/vMLX.app` and bundled Python `vmlx_engine 1.5.56`.
- Qwen27 max-256 failed:
  `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-installed-app-qwen36-27b-jang4m-mtp-responses-tools-video-reasoning-cachecontrols-max256-20260607-proof.json`.
- Qwen27 max-256 classification: server decoded the MP4 and processed video, but the final media turn stopped reasoning-only at max tokens with no visible answer. This is a thinking-mode output-budget boundary, not a video runtime crash.
- Qwen27 max-512 passed:
  `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-installed-app-qwen36-27b-jang4m-mtp-responses-tools-video-reasoning-cachecontrols-max512-20260607-proof.json`.
- Qwen35 max-512 passed:
  `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-installed-app-qwen36-35b-mxfp8-mtp-responses-tools-video-reasoning-cachecontrols-max512-20260607-proof.json`.
- Both passing installed-app video proofs decoded the MP4 data URL, extracted six frames, returned visible video content, and proved `video_where_supported`, reasoning display, Responses streaming/cache detail, built-in tool loop, native MTP, typed `hybrid_ssm_v1`, TurboQuant attention KV, block L2, SSM L2, server cache controls, settings persistence, parser/language leak checks, and media-safe skip of media prompt cache store.
- Boundary: this records installed-app video evidence but does not yet wire these video artifacts into the generated manifest/checklist. Remaining Qwen blockers are largest-context tail inspection, cancellation cleanup matrix, installed-app video manifest/checklist wiring, and packaged acceleration symbol parity.

## 2026-06-07 local - Qwen installed-app video objective wiring

- Wired Qwen installed-app video proofs into the full objective checklist:
  `tests/cross_matrix/run_full_release_objective_checklist.py`.
- Added focused fixture coverage:
  `tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py`.
- Enforced artifacts:
  - `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-installed-app-qwen36-27b-jang4m-mtp-responses-tools-video-reasoning-cachecontrols-max512-20260607-proof.json`
  - `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-installed-app-qwen36-35b-mxfp8-mtp-responses-tools-video-reasoning-cachecontrols-max512-20260607-proof.json`
- New checklist assertions require installed-app route, requested video, visible output, `video_where_supported`, reasoning display, Responses streaming/cache detail, tool+L2 integration, six processed frames, typed `hybrid_ssm_v1`, native MTP depth 3, `paged+ssm` cache detail, block L2 writes, and SSM companion disk stores.
- Validation passed: py_compile for edited files and focused checklist pytest (`2 passed`).
- Regenerated full checklist:
  `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-qwen-installed-video-wiring-20260607.json`.
- Generated state remains release-red: `status=open`, `failed_count=17`. Remaining generated blockers are MiMo exactness/long/CB/source/media, MiniMax #179 reporter parity/root cause, DSV4 insufficient memory/exact code-file-long output, real UI full matrix, and prepackage/release gates.

## 2026-06-07 local - MiniMax #179 refreshed boundary

- Refreshed MiniMax #179 root-cause audit:
  `build/current-issue179-minimax-k-root-cause-audit-after-qwen-installed-video-wiring-20260607.json`.
- Result remains `status=open`.
- Local proven clean rows: current source Responses cancel contract, inactive cancel 404 contract, latest public DMG cancel route, local installed bundle cancel route, local installed session settings parity, local installed Responses cancel live probe, and local real-UI diagnostics.
- Current missing reporter rows: reporter parity artifact, reporter model shard/codebook hash comparison, reporter model manifest, reporter installed/public/local server hash match, reporter response active at cancel, reporter chat/session/settings parity, screenshot-shaped prompt reproduction, and proof that 404 cancel caused the screenshot rather than followed stream abort.
- Updated full-objective checklist pointer to consume the refreshed audit.
- Validation passed: py_compile for edited checklist files and focused checklist pytest (`2 passed`).
- Regenerated full checklist:
  `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-issue179-refresh-20260607.json`.
- Generated state remains release-red: `status=open`, `failed_count=17`.
- Boundary: MiniMax #179 cannot be honestly cleared from local-only evidence. Reporter-machine parity metadata must be captured with `tests/cross_matrix/run_issue179_reporter_parity_metadata.py --capture-provenance reporter_machine ...` or equivalent reporter logs/session/cancel lifecycle proof.

## 2026-06-07 local - Qwen27 long-context cache-tail proof

- Ran installed/bundled Qwen27 long-context cache-tail proof:
  `build/current-qwen27-jang4m-mtp-installed-long-context-cache-tail-20260607.json`.
- Result: `status=pass`.
- Cold request used a `31,647` input-token prompt and returned exact begin/middle/end anchor markers.
- Cold cache writes: 495 block-L2 entries, `31,646` block tokens on disk, and `63,262` SSM companion tokens on disk.
- Warm request returned exact markers again in `9.5s` with `cached_tokens=31646`, `cache_detail=paged+ssm`, 1,485 block-disk hits, typed `hybrid_ssm_v1`, TurboQuant attention KV enabled, and native MTP active.
- Wired the proof into the full objective checklist and added focused fixture coverage.
- Validation passed: py_compile for edited files and focused checklist pytest (`2 passed`).
- Regenerated full checklist:
  `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-qwen27-long-context-cache-tail-20260607.json`.
- Generated state remains release-red: `status=open`, `failed_count=17`.
- Boundary: Qwen27 largest-context cache-tail is now green; Qwen35 still needs comparable 30k-token largest-context tail proof, and Qwen cancellation cleanup/packaged acceleration parity remain open.

## 2026-06-07 local - MiMo loader/defaults work

- Patched `vmlx_engine/models/mllm.py` to install split-shard packed affine MiMo qkv and dense MLP projections as `nn.QuantizedLinear` instead of leaving uint32 packed tensors inside plain `nn.Linear`.
- Confirmed classic MiMo JANG_2L no longer dies at the first qkv/MLP matmul path and reaches generation, but measured path is still speed-red under tight memory.
- Treated MiMo JANGTQ_2 speed as accepted by Eric for now; kept exact speed evidence in status rather than claiming a hidden 40+ steady-state default.
- Patched `vmlx_engine/server.py` so `generation_config.do_sample=false` is respected as greedy sampling for omitted request defaults unless JANG chat sampling metadata or explicit request/CLI values override it.
- Patched panel generation-default plumbing in `panel/src/main/ipc/models.ts`, `panel/src/main/sessions.ts`, `panel/src/main/server.ts`, `panel/src/env.d.ts`, `panel/src/shared/chatSettingsResetPolicy.ts`, `panel/src/renderer/src/components/sessions/CreateSession.tsx`, `panel/src/renderer/src/components/sessions/SessionSettings.tsx`, and `panel/src/renderer/src/components/sessions/SessionConfigForm.tsx`.
- Validation: Python compile passed, panel typecheck passed, live MiMo JANGTQ_2 omitted-sampling request logged deterministic defaults and returned `ok`.

## 2026-06-07 local - do_sample=false regression + MiMo deterministic rerun

- Added regression coverage for `generation_config.do_sample=false` in backend and panel generation defaults.
- Refreshed generation defaults contract to `build/current-generation-defaults-contract-after-do-sample-false-mimo-20260607.json` and updated current release/objective pointers.
- Reran MiMo JANGTQ_2 no-media tools/cache smoke after the deterministic-default fix. Cache, block-L2, tool parser structure, code whitespace, and speed are green, but exact literal tool/JSON values still mutate under deterministic sampling.
- Refreshed MiMo audit and full release checklist. Release remains blocked; no signing/notarization/release work performed.

## 2026-06-07 local - startup parity made explicit

- Tightened AGENTS and the release tracker so startup proof must cover both CLI `vmlx serve` and MLXStudio generated launch/session settings.
- Required parity now includes parser, reasoning, cache, MTP, max output, max context, and model-owned generation defaults.
- Current green source contract is still `build/current-generation-defaults-contract-after-do-sample-false-mimo-20260607.json`; it is not a substitute for per-family live API/UI/installed-app proof.

## 2026-06-07 local - full release objective guard expanded

- Expanded `AGENTS.md` with the current objective execution contract for the active Python engine plus MLXStudio app release.
- Added explicit surfaces future agents must keep tied together: CLI startup, MLXStudio startup, Chat Completions, Responses, tools, structured output, cache, TurboQuant KV, media, installed app, per-family model gates, and signing/notarization lock.
- Added per-family must-prove rows for MiMo, Qwen MTP, Gemma4, Step3.7, LFM, Nemo/Nemotron Omni, MiniMax, DSV4, ZAYA, and hybrid families.
- This is not a release-clearance claim. It is a control-plane hardening step so future work does not narrow the objective to a single test, one model smoke, upload chore, or deprecated workspace.

## 2026-06-07 local - control-plane validation

- Focused validation passed: py_compile for checklist/manifest/proof summary scripts and `tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py` (`2 passed`).
- Added and passed `tests/test_agents_release_control_plane.py` (`3 passed`) so future edits that remove the active vMLX/MLXStudio release objective, startup parity, per-family gates, no-fake-fix rules, or release lock will fail a no-heavy regression test.
- Wired `tests/test_agents_release_control_plane.py` into the current regression suite focused pytest command and source-hash set.
- Focused suite validation passed: `4 passed`, `73 deselected`; compile validation for the edited suite/test files also passed.
- Added explicit release manifest source-hash expectation for `tests/test_agents_release_control_plane.py`.
- Focused manifest validation passed: `1 passed`, `386 deselected`; compile validation for the manifest test/source files also passed.
- Regenerated full checklist:
  `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-agents-control-plane-20260607.json`.
- Expected result remains red: `status=open`, `failed_count=17`.
- No model launch, source-vs-quant load, package build, signing, notarization, tag, push, or public download update was performed.

## 2026-06-07 local - MiMo exactness no-source classifier

- Added no-heavy MiMo classifier runner and tests.
- Artifact: `build/current-mimo-v2-no-source-exactness-classifier-after-do-sample-false-20260607.json`.
- Classification: `model_generated_literal_mutation_after_valid_parser_structure`.
- Excluded by current evidence: parser-side semantic rewrite, cache/KV/L2 primary cause, hidden stochastic sampling where deterministic logs are present.
- Still unresolved: artifact quantization vs runtime decode logits because source-vs-quant load remains disallowed for RAM; long prompt, CB/system prompt pressure, and media runtime remain red.
- Validation: `tests/test_mimo_v2_no_source_exactness_classifier.py` passed (`2 passed`); py_compile passed. Runner returned open/nonzero as expected because this is not release-cleared.
- Wired the classifier unit test into the current regression suite focused pytest gate/source-hash list and release manifest source-hash expectation.
- Focused wiring validation passed: `4 passed`, `385 deselected`; compile validation passed.
- Wired the classifier artifact into the full release checklist MiMo group.
- Full-checklist validation passed (`2 passed`) and regenerated
  `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-mimo-manifest-classifier-sync-20260607.json`.
- Generated checklist remains `status=open`, `failed_count=17`; this preserves release lock while improving MiMo exactness evidence.
- Updated full-checklist default output and current-regression-suite command to use the MiMo-classifier checklist artifact.
- Focused pointer validation passed: `5 passed`, `72 deselected`; compile validation passed.

## 2026-06-07 local - MiMo classifier release-manifest wiring

- Wired `build/current-mimo-v2-no-source-exactness-classifier-after-do-sample-false-20260607.json` into `_validate_current_mimo_v2_jang2l_root_cause`.
- The release manifest now exposes classifier status, classification, parser/cache/sampling exclusion, unresolved artifact/decode surfaces, and the no-source/source-vs-quant skip boundary.
- Focused validation passed: `5 passed`, `308 deselected`; compile validation passed.
- Regenerated release manifest:
  `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-mimo-no-source-classifier-20260607.json`.
- Manifest remains red: `current_proof_sweep=fail`, `prepackage_ready=false`, `release_ready=false`.

## 2026-06-07 local - classifier-aware full checklist manifest sync

- Updated full-checklist release-manifest pointer to `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-mimo-no-source-classifier-20260607.json`.
- Regenerated full checklist:
  `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-mimo-manifest-classifier-sync-20260607.json`.
- Result remains red: `status=open`, `failed_count=17`.
- Updated current-suite/default checklist pointers to the manifest-sync artifact.
- Focused validation passed: `10 passed`, `382 deselected`; compile validation passed.

## 2026-06-07 local - objective proof refreshed after classifier manifest sync

- Refreshed current no-heavy contracts used by objective digest so stale source hashes no longer create false open rows.
- Regenerated `build/current-objective-proof-after-mimo-manifest-classifier-sync-20260607.json`.
- Digest is now back to the true high-level state: 20 PASS / 6 OPEN.
- Focused validation passed: `108 passed`, `385 deselected`; compile validation passed.
- No model load, source-vs-quant, package build, signing, notarization, tag, push, or download update.

## 2026-06-07 local - CLI/UI startup parity guardrail refresh

- Patched `AGENTS.md` to refresh current classifier-aware artifact pointers and explicitly state that CLI startup and MLXStudio startup are independent release gates.
- Patched `tests/test_agents_release_control_plane.py` to pin that distinction.
- Validation: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_agents_release_control_plane.py` -> `3 passed`.
- Regenerated current no-heavy release manifest, full checklist, and objective proof artifacts; release remains blocked.

## 2026-06-07 local - generation defaults startup-parity gate refresh

- Patched `tests/cross_matrix/run_generation_defaults_contract.py` to add `panel_cli_startup_contract` and matrix row `cli_mlxstudio_startup_parity`.
- Patched `tests/test_generation_defaults_contract.py` to pin the current artifact path and startup-parity matrix row.
- Validation: `tests/test_generation_defaults_contract.py tests/test_panel_cli_flag_contract.py` -> `12 passed`.
- Regenerated `build/current-generation-defaults-contract-after-do-sample-false-mimo-20260607.json` -> `status=pass`, no missing markers.
- Focused manifest/objective validation -> `128 passed`, `368 deselected`.

## 2026-06-07 local - real-UI unblocked non-MiMo classifier refresh

- Patched `tests/cross_matrix/release_regression_manifest.py` for current DSV4 memory preflight path and exact Qwen36 variant set handling.
- Patched `tests/test_release_regression_manifest.py` fixtures/assertions for DSV4 memory blocker, Qwen36 27B+35B required variants, and current LFM25/Qwen36 proof filenames.
- Validation: focused DSV4/unblocked matrix tests -> `6 passed`; broader real-UI matrix/current-suite/objective selectors -> `143 passed`, `350 deselected`; py_compile passed.
- Regenerated current release manifest, full checklist, and objective proof; unblocked non-MiMo row is PASS, release remains locked.

## 2026-06-07 local - cross-family live smoke matrix stale ZAYA aggregation refresh

- Patched `tests/cross_matrix/summarize_objective_proof.py` to use current filtered ZAYA text live smoke artifact.
- Patched `tests/test_objective_proof_digest.py` fixture to cover the current filtered ZAYA text artifact.
- Regenerated current objective proof, release manifest, and full checklist. Non-MiMo live smoke is green; cross-family row remains open only because MiMo is still red.
- Validation: `tests/test_objective_proof_digest.py -k cross_family_live_smoke` -> `2 passed`; broader objective/current-suite/manifest selectors -> `108 passed`, `385 deselected`; py_compile passed.

## 2026-06-09 Codex release-gate continuation

- Active repo only: `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx` on `main` at `5571c8ab`.
- Rebuilt bundled Python for release packaging; verifier now passes with `vmlx_engine 1.5.56`, `jang 2.5.30`, MiMo registration, JANGTQ loaders, TurboQuant kernels, Step3p7 VLM runtime, and Gemma4 unified registration/imports green.
- Produced N2 local memory preflight artifact: `build/current-n2-pro-jang1l-local-memory-preflight-20260609.json`; local N2 JANG_1L exists with index and about `118.73GB` payload, but current host classification remains `do_not_launch` because live proof reaches health then Metal working-set guard rejects generation.
- Produced N2 no-heavy API/cache and cache-architecture artifacts: `build/current-noheavy-api-cache-contract-after-mimo-n2-runtime-refresh-20260609.json` and `build/current-cache-architecture-contract-after-mimo-n2-runtime-refresh-20260609.json`, both pass.
- Built staged Sequoia app: `panel/release/sequoia-app/mac-arm64/vMLX.app`; Developer ID signed by ShieldStack LLC and `codesign --verify --deep --strict` passes.
- Built staged Tahoe app: `panel/release/tahoe-app/mac-arm64/vMLX.app`; Developer ID signed by ShieldStack LLC and `codesign --verify --deep --strict` passes.
- Packaged integrity now fails only on `release_gate_skip_app`; the previous bundled-python and Developer ID app signing blockers are cleared for staged apps.
- Refreshed manifest/checklist: `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-structured-schema-decode-20260609.json` remains `prepackage_ready=false`, `release_ready=false`; `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-mimo-n2-bundled-refresh-20260609.json` remains `status=open`, `failed_count=187`.
- Remaining true blockers include MiMo current audit/exactness/media rows, N2 live runtime/API/UI release clearance, DSV4 live cache/tool/code proof, Qwen/Ling/Gemma live speed/quality rows, MiniMax reporter/live UI rows, and real Electron UI cross-family matrix. Do not notarize/release without explicit override.

## [2026-06-09 00:48] Codex | progress | merged issue/proof ledger for release lane
- Active source: canonical `main` at `798c84a6` (`Refresh cross-model metadata route audit`), including parallel-agent commits `4194892c` Qwen plain-line tool-call repair, `e7d0e65f` MiMo completion-logprob classifier fix, `ed9af3b4` bare JSON tool-argument repair, `464f4c3f` structured smoke `response_format`, and `cf530dfb` guided JSON schema token masking.
- Installed app: `/Applications/vMLX.app` refreshed from current Tahoe/native staged app after `03aa3c16`; critical engine hash parity still passes at `798c84a6` because `798c84a6` is metadata-audit/test-only. Artifact `build/current-installed-app-runtime-parity-audit-after-installed-app-rebuild-20260606.json`, `status=pass`, no hash mismatches.
- Packaged integrity: `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-after-bundled-python-sync-20260608.json`, `status=fail` only on `release_gate_skip_app` / `dry_release_gate_fails_only_on_known_objectives`; bundled Python verifier and staged app hash parity are not the active failure.
- Public issue audit: `build/current-public-app-issue-audit-after-installed-parity-refresh-20260609.json`, `status=fail`; now `#111` and `#166` pass, `#165` is open only because live default-cache DSV4 tool-loop proof is missing, and `#117`, `#180`, `#119`, `#115` remain open/failing for MiniMax/Gemma live UI, memory, and speed proofs.
- Tool-call contract: `build/current-tool-call-contract-after-cross-model-loop-metrics-20260609.json`, `status=open`; source/panel/parser tests pass but `live_default_cache_dsv4_tool_loop_artifact_present=false` and `...passed=false`.
- #188 metadata/runtime-route matrix: `build/current-local-generation-metadata-route-audit-after-pr-intake-20260609.json`, `status=pass`, `rows=15`; Step3p7 concrete repro bundles are included and notes distinguish `step3p7_advertised_media_routes_source_vlm_runtime` from the old unsafe metadata route.
- MiMo boundary: current JANGTQ2 conservative proof with continuous batching off, prefix cache off, and KV cache quantization none still mutates compact literals; corrected logprob classifier marks wrong literal outputs as greedy top-1, so do not chase prefix/paged/L2/CB/KV/parser as the primary cause without contrary logits evidence. Treat as artifact/logit quality or lower decode/kernel boundary.
- Release boundary: not notarized, not release-ready. Do not tag/upload public release until live DSV4 tool-loop, MiniMax UI/numeric proof, Gemma26/Gemma4/Qwen speed and UI proofs, MiMo exactness/media rows, and objective checklist/release manifest are honestly green or explicitly scoped.

## [2026-06-09 01:10] Codex | progress | #165 DSV4 default-cache tool loop cleared
- Source pushed: `74d338b4` (`Repair schema-keyed DSML parameters`) on `origin/main`.
- Runtime fix: `vmlx_engine/tool_parsers/dsml_tool_parser.py` now schema-gates DSV4 degraded DSML parameters like `<｜DSML｜parameter content string="true">...` and maps `content` to the request tool schema key while preserving generated bytes exactly. It does not repair corrupted code identifiers.
- Regression: `tests/test_dsml_tool_parser.py::TestDSMLToolParser::test_repairs_schema_keyed_dsml_parameter_without_rewriting_code` proves the parser extracts `write_file` but keeps generated `WebWebGLRenderer` / `MMeshBasicMaterial` corruption unchanged.
- Focused verification: py_compile passed; DSML focused parser/tool tests passed (`6 passed, 687 deselected`).
- Installed app rebuilt/installed from fixed Tahoe/native app; `build/current-installed-app-runtime-parity-audit-after-installed-app-rebuild-20260606.json` is `status=pass`, no bundled engine hash mismatches.
- Live DSV4 installed-app proof: `build/current-dsv4-default-cache-tool-loop/result.json`, `status=review`; required runtime checks all true: ordered tools `list_directory`, `write_file`, `write_file`, final `DONE`, native DSV4 prefix/paged/L2 true, generic TQ KV off, cached tokens seen (`625`) with `paged+dsv4` cache detail. Code exactness remains false and visible in `code_tool_probe`.
- Tool-call contract: `build/current-tool-call-contract-after-cross-model-loop-metrics-20260609.json`, `status=pass`; public audit now marks issue `#165` pass.
- Packaged apps: Tahoe/native and Sequoia/compat staged apps rebuilt and Developer ID signed; `codesign --verify --deep --strict` passed for both. `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-after-bundled-python-sync-20260608.json` remains `status=fail` only on `release_gate_skip_app`; notarization still skipped.
- Remaining public blockers after this slice: `#117`, `#180`, `#119`, and `#115`; broader MiMo exactness/media, N2 live rows, UI proof, speed gates, checklist/manifest, notarization, and release upload remain open.

## [2026-06-09 01:18] Codex | partial/pass | #180 MiniMax Small installed real-UI strict-tools proof
- Blocker reduced: `api/ui` + `parser/template` for MiniMax-M2.7-Small-JANGTQ real UI Responses strict-tools/cachecontrols language/numeric leak gate.
- Failed first with model-owned sampling defaults (`temperature=1.0`, `top_p=0.95`): tools/cache/UI passed but second visible assistant turn included Chinese text, so this was a real visible-language quality failure, not parser/cache/tool plumbing.
- Minimal variable proof passed with explicit deterministic UI sampling (`VMLINUX_REAL_UI_TEMPERATURE=0`), thinking disabled, Responses API, built-in tools, server cache controls, and installed app `/Applications/vMLX.app`.
- Proof artifact: `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-minimax-m27-small-responses-stricttools-cachecontrols-20260530-proof.json`, `status=pass`.
- Key proof details: `uiLaunchMode=installed-app`, `modelName=servedModel=MiniMax-M2.7-Small-JANGTQ`, `cacheHitTokens=6516`, `cache_detail=paged+tq`, block-disk L2 present, tool files written exactly, `cjkLeakCount=0`, `koreanLeakCount=0`, `reasoningCjkLeakCount=0`, `reasoningKoreanLeakCount=0`, `reasoningNumericRunCount=0`.
- Proven surfaces include `installed_app_ui`, `responses_api`, `responses_delta_streaming`, `responses_cache_detail_usage`, `server_cache_controls`, `cache_hit_telemetry`, `l2_disk_storage`, `long_tool_loop`, `tool_l2_cache_integrated`, `parser_leak_check`, and `language_leak_check`.
- Public audit artifact: `build/current-public-app-issue-audit-after-minimax-stricttools-proof-20260609.json`, overall `status=fail`; #180 is `pass`, #117 now has `minimax_live_ui_artifacts_indexed=true` but remains `open_minimax_k_issue179_reporter_parity_required`; #119 still fails and #115 remains open.
- Boundary: do not claim MiniMax defaults are universally clean; default sampling produced visible Chinese leakage. The release-safe strict-tools proof is deterministic sampling through the installed UI.

# 2026-06-09 03:14 PDT - Gemma4 unified direct import startup fix

- Stayed in active repo `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx`; did not use deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`.
- Reported failure: `Process exited before becoming ready: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mlx_vlm.models.gemma4_unified'`.
- Reproduced source state: `importlib.util.find_spec('mlx_vlm.models.gemma4_unified')` returned `None` before vMLX registration; explicit `register_gemma4_unified_runtime()` worked, proving the vendored runtime existed but the direct namespace was not resolvable early enough.
- Added regression: `tests/test_engine_audit.py::TestStartupCompatibilityGuards::test_gemma4_unified_runtime_import_hook_resolves_direct_mlx_vlm_path`.
- Fix: extended the existing no-eager-mlx-vlm registry import hook in `vmlx_engine/__init__.py` so `mlx_vlm.models.gemma4_unified` and its submodules resolve to `vmlx_engine/models/gemma4_unified` under the exact upstream namespace.
- Verification:
  - regression failed before fix with the reported `ModuleNotFoundError`.
  - `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_engine_audit.py -k "gemma4_unified_runtime_import_hook or bundled_python_import_gate_covers_gemma4_unified_runtime"` -> 2 passed.
  - direct import proof after `import vmlx_engine`: `mlx_vlm.models.gemma4_unified` resolved to vendored `vmlx_engine/models/gemma4_unified/__init__.py`; `Model` and `Gemma4UnifiedProcessor` present.
  - `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile vmlx_engine/__init__.py tests/test_engine_audit.py` -> pass.
  - `git diff --check -- vmlx_engine/__init__.py tests/test_engine_audit.py` -> pass.
- Boundary: not release-cleared. This fixes only the direct startup import class. Remaining open items still include all model/parser/cache/media/UI/release blockers in STATUS.

# 2026-06-09 03:18 PDT - Gemma QAT/native MXFP4 release matrix scope

- Stayed in active repo `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, Max2, ADLab, transport, signing, notarization, tag, or download work.
- Added explicit Gemma QAT/native MXFP4 rows to `.agents/RELEASE_BLOCKER_LEDGER_20260609.md` and `docs/internal/VMLX_MLXSTUDIO_RELEASE_EXECUTION_TRACKER_2026_06_07.md`.
- New rows cover Gemma 3n E2B/E4B QAT/native 4-bit, Gemma4 12B native MXFP4/QAT-style bundles, and Gemma4 26B/31V VL/video-capable bundles where present.
- Required proof now explicitly includes: model-owned generation defaults, visual/audio/video where advertised, Gemma3/Gemma4 parser selection, required/auto/no-tool/tool-result continuation, multi-turn recall, raw parser/reasoning leak checks, JSON/XML/code exactness, content-delta and Responses function-call-argument streaming, prefix/paged/mixed-SWA/native cache telemetry, TurboQuant KV encode/decode boundaries where valid, block-disk L2 write, fresh-process L2 restore, CLI/UI parser/cache/max-output/max-context parity, and installed-app startup parity.
- Added registry regression for Gemma3n E2B/E4B QAT/native rows so they cannot drift to `unknown` or lose the `gemma3` tool parser.
- Boundary: this is matrix/proof-scope plus registry coverage only. It does not live-clear any Gemma QAT/native MXFP4 media/cache/UI row and does not release/sign/notarize.

# 2026-06-09 03:19 PDT - Gemma local QAT/native MXFP4 inventory

- Wrote shallow inventory artifact `build/current-gemma-qat-native-mxfp4-local-inventory-20260609.json` from `/Users/eric/models` and `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models`.
- Found 11 Gemma config rows: local Gemma4 12B JANG/MXFP variants, Gemma4 26B JANG_4M CRACK, and Gemma4 31B JANG_4M-MTP. All present Gemma4 rows advertise vision/audio/video at config level, so release proof must either pass media or capability-gate honestly per bundle.
- Did not find Gemma 3n E2B/E4B QAT/native 4-bit bundles locally. Keep rows open until models are downloaded/provided and live tested.
- Boundary: inventory is not live runtime proof; no signing/release/package work.

# 2026-06-09 03:24 PDT - Gemma QAT/native MXFP4 inventory gate

- Added no-heavy cross-matrix gate `tests/cross_matrix/run_gemma_qat_native_mxfp4_inventory_gate.py` and tests `tests/test_gemma_qat_native_mxfp4_inventory_gate.py`.
- The gate inventories local Gemma configs, classifies required QAT/native rows, and records required live proof surfaces. It intentionally keeps present rows `open` until live media/cache/tool/Responses/UI/installed-app proof exists.
- Refreshed `build/current-gemma-qat-native-mxfp4-local-inventory-20260609.json`: `status=open`, `count=11`, missing `gemma3n_e2b_qat_native4` and `gemma3n_e4b_qat_native4`; open present `gemma4_12b_native_mxfp4`, `gemma4_26b_vl`, `gemma4_31v_or_31b_vl`.
- Updated tracked release execution tracker with the gate status and exact missing/open row names.
- Validation: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_gemma_qat_native_mxfp4_inventory_gate.py tests/test_model_config_registry.py -k "gemma_qat_native_mxfp4_inventory_gate or gemma3n_e2b_e4b_qat_configs"` -> 3 passed; runner completed; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: no downloads, no live heavy model load, no package/sign/notarize/release. This reduces proof tracking only and keeps release locked.

# 2026-06-09 03:27 PDT - Gemma QAT inventory gate current-suite wiring

- Added TDD regression coverage in `tests/test_current_regression_suite.py` to require the Gemma QAT/native MXFP4 inventory gate sources in `CURRENT_SUITE_SOURCE_HASH_FILES` and require a `gemma_qat_native_mxfp4_inventory_gate` command table entry.
- Verified the new tests failed before wiring: source hashes missing and command key absent.
- Wired `tests/cross_matrix/run_current_regression_suite.py` to hash and execute `tests/cross_matrix/run_gemma_qat_native_mxfp4_inventory_gate.py`, include `tests/test_gemma_qat_native_mxfp4_inventory_gate.py`, and select `gemma_qat_inventory_gate` in focused pytest.
- Validation: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_current_regression_suite.py -k "gemma_qat_inventory_gate or source_hash_list_matches_release_manifest"` -> 3 passed; `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_release_regression_manifest.py -k "source_hash_list_matches_current_suite_runner or source_hashes_all_referenced_code_files"` -> 2 passed; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: no live heavy model load and no release action. This only prevents proof-map drift for the already-open Gemma QAT/native MXFP4 rows.

# 2026-06-09 03:40 PDT - Responses server SSE tool proof-map refresh

- Stayed in active repo `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, signing, notarization, tag, package, or release work.
- Blocker reduced: `api/ui` + `parser/template` source proof tracking for Responses streaming tool calls.
- TDD red: `tests/test_current_regression_suite.py::test_noheavy_api_cache_contract_includes_server_responses_tool_streaming_order` failed before wiring because `run_noheavy_api_cache_contract.py` did not include the server Responses tool streaming markers/check.
- Source/proof-map fix: `tests/cross_matrix/run_noheavy_api_cache_contract.py` now has `responses_streaming_tool_contracts` and check `responses_streaming_tool_call_arguments_and_indexes`; release manifest expected checks include the same row.
- Regenerated proof: `build/current-noheavy-api-cache-contract-after-xml-docs-boundary-20260609.json`, `status=pass`, `missing_markers=[]`, `responses_streaming_tool_call_arguments_and_indexes=true`, command `responses_streaming_tool_contracts rc=0 passed=4`.
- Verified server tests cover: buffered args, reasoning-channel args without reasoning-disable workaround, tool-only `output_index` ordering, and fail-closed missing required XML args.
- Focused validation: current-suite no-heavy slice `6/6`; release-manifest API/current-suite slice `3/3`; server Responses tool stream slice `4/4`; py_compile passed; `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: this tracks current-source server proof only. Raw SSE local-vs-gateway-vs-tunnel proof, installed-app/UI execution, N2 JANG_1L memory-safe live path, DSV4, MiniMax, MiMo, Gemma media/cache/UI, and release readiness remain open.

# 2026-06-09 03:31 PDT - Gemma QAT rows in full release checklist

- Added full release checklist support for `GEMMA_QAT_NATIVE_MXFP4_INVENTORY` and new group `gemma_qat_native_mxfp4`.
- TDD: `test_full_release_objective_checklist_blocks_open_gemma_qat_inventory` failed first because the checklist runner had no `GEMMA_QAT_NATIVE_MXFP4_INVENTORY` constant.
- Implemented strict checks: inventory artifact exists/status pass, E2B present, E4B present, Gemma4 12B native MXFP4 present, Gemma4 26B present, Gemma4 31V-or-31B present, and all live proofs present with no missing/open rows.
- Refreshed local full checklist; Gemma QAT group is open with expected failures for status pass, missing E2B/E4B, and live proofs.
- Validation: `tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py` -> 5 passed; focused current-suite and release-manifest source-list tests passed; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: proof/checklist integration only. No model download/load, no package/sign/notarize/release.

# 2026-06-09 03:55 PDT - Responses preamble empty-XML tool-call boundary

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, package, signing, notarization, tag, or release work.
- Blocker reduced: #192/#190 `parser/template` + `api/ui` proof tracking for Qwen/Qwen-Coder-style streamed preamble followed by `<tool_call><function=exec_command></function></tool_call>`.
- Verified the pasted root-cause claim against current source instead of trusting it: the XML-function parser can produce `{}`, but server request-schema filtering drops the tool call when required `cmd` is missing/empty. Streaming Responses emits `tool_calls_required`; it does not emit an executable `function_call` with `{}`.
- Added explicit regression `test_streaming_responses_preamble_empty_xml_tool_call_never_emits_empty_arguments`; it asserts visible preamble preservation, no `function_call` item, no `response.function_call_arguments.*` events, and no serialized `"arguments": "{}"` payload.
- Proof-map update: no-heavy API/cache contract now includes that marker in `responses_streaming_tool_contracts`.
- Refreshed proof: `build/current-noheavy-api-cache-contract-after-xml-docs-boundary-20260609.json`, `status=pass`, `missing_markers=[]`, `responses_streaming_tool_contracts rc=0 passed=5`.
- Boundary: do not implement a fallback that invents `cmd` from the preamble; missing required args must fail closed. Do not close #192 publicly until rebuilt/installed app proof exists; #190 remains open for live DSV4/default-cache/tool-loop and broader cross-family rows.

# 2026-06-09 04:20 PDT - Responses gateway reasoning empty-final-args boundary

- Blocker reduced: #190/#192 local MLXStudio gateway/panel Responses SSE argument preservation when reasoning is present and final `response.output_item.done.item.arguments` is empty.
- Source/proof-map fix: added panel regression `passes Responses argument SSE with reasoning and empty final item arguments`; no-heavy API/cache contract now requires `gateway_responses_reasoning_empty_final_arguments_streaming`, and release manifest expects that check.
- Proof artifact: `build/current-noheavy-api-cache-contract-after-responses-reasoning-empty-final-args-gateway-20260609.json`, `status=pass`, `missing_markers=[]`, `panel_gateway_contracts rc=0 passed=5`, `responses_streaming_tool_contracts rc=0 passed=5`.
- Other-agent reminder: keep the server fail-closed rule for missing required XML args; do not synthesize tool args from preamble text. This gateway row proves local pass-through/recovery only, not public tunnel parity, rebuilt installed-app behavior, or release readiness.

# 2026-06-09 05:06 PDT - Responses raw SSE parity capture harness

- Blocker reduced: #190/#192 raw direct-vs-gateway-vs-tunnel SSE proof classification.
- Source/proof-map fix: added `tests/cross_matrix/run_responses_raw_sse_parity_contract.py` plus unit tests. The classifier reconstructs authoritative function-call args from `response.function_call_arguments.delta/done` and detects lost gateway/tunnel args separately from an empty final `output_item.done.item.arguments`.
- Current artifact: `build/current-responses-raw-sse-parity-20260609.json`, `status=open`, `missing_captures=[direct,gateway,tunnel]`; this is intentional because no live raw captures were supplied in this slice.
- Validation: parity classifier tests passed `4/4`; current-suite source-hash guard passed; release-manifest source-hash mirror passed; py_compile and `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: not a live tunnel proof and not issue closure. Pass requires direct local server, panel gateway, and tunnel raw SSE captures with matching authoritative arguments.

# 2026-06-09 04:38 PDT - Gemma4 cross-shard MoE sidecars and audio waveform source fix

- Continued from concurrent edits without reverting them.
- Blocker reduced: #191/#188 Gemma4 QAT/native MXFP4 loader/media source correctness for MoE bundles and Gemma4 audio inputs.
- Source fix: Gemma4 MoE native-MXFP expert sidecars now hydrate `.scales`/`.biases` from the safetensors index when packed expert weights and sidecars land in different shards, then split/dequant into runtime `experts.switch_glu.{gate,up,down}_proj.weight`.
- Source fix: Gemma4/Gemma4 Unified audio requests now decode temp WAV paths into float32 waveform arrays before calling processors that expect raw waveform arrays.
- Source fix: `_run_vision_encoding_inner` now uses a fallback request id for request-like internal test/probe objects that do not expose `request_id`, preserving MiMo/media prefill guard telemetry without crashing unit fixtures.
- Regressions/proof: `test_gemma4_moe_mxfp_expert_cross_shard_sidecars_are_hydrated`, `test_gemma4_moe_mxfp_vlm_loader_initializes_sidecar_weight_map`, `test_gemma4_audio_waveforms_from_paths_decodes_wav_to_float32`; model-artifact-format proof `build/current-model-artifact-format-contract-after-gemma4-cross-shard-sidecars-audio-waveform-20260609.json`, `status=pass`, `missing_markers=[]`, `model_artifact_format_pytest rc=0 passed=179 deselected=192`.
- Live 26B QAT proof after sidecar fix: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-26b-qat-mxfp4-tools-l2-nomedia-after-cross-shard-expert-sidecars-20260609b/summary.json`, `status=fail` only for two narrow rows. Cleared incoherence: exact `ACK`, mixed-SWA cache hit `cached_tokens=56` / `cache_detail=paged+mixed_swa`, multi-turn `blue cat`, required tool `record_fact({"value":"blue-cat"})`, JSON exact, code exact whitespace, image `Blue`/`Red`, video fallback `Blue`, and block-disk L2 restart `disk_hits=2`.
- Remaining boundary: tool-result continuation omits final period (`STORED blue-cat` vs `STORED blue-cat.`), and Gemma4 QAT audio still fails honestly because the processor returns no supported audio feature payload. No installed-app proof and no release/sign/package action.

# 2026-06-09 04:37 PDT - Gemma4 audio input_features forwarding and #192 empty XML recheck

- Blocker reduced: #191/#188 `media` source path after the 26B QAT audio row failed with `audio_processor_payload_missing`.
- Continued from the existing in-flight MLLM audio diff without reverting it.
- Source fix: Gemma4/Gemma4 Unified processor-returned `input_features` and `input_features_mask` are promoted out of `extra_kwargs`, included in media cache salting, and forwarded to the model as `input_features`/`input_features_mask` instead of being discarded or mis-aliased as MiMo `audio_embeds`.
- Source fix: Gemma4 audio prompts missing native audio placeholders now append the processor audio token once per audio input before processor execution.
- Compatibility fix: `_run_vision_encoding_inner` now reads optional `audio_input_features` fields with `getattr`, so older request-like probes without the new attributes still take the correct audio/model-wrapper path.
- Focused proof: `tests/test_mllm_scheduler_cache.py -k "audio or processor_direct"` plus explicit Gemma4 `input_features` and placeholder tests passed `9/9`; `tests/test_gemma4_audio_waveform_decode.py` passed `1/1`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
- #192 recheck: reran the exact server regressions for `output_index`, required empty XML rejection, and streamed preamble plus empty XML. They passed `3/3`. Current source fails the empty-args shape closed with `tool_calls_required`; it does not emit executable `arguments:"{}"` for the required `cmd` schema.
- Other-agent reminder: keep the #192 list item as a verified fail-closed server/source boundary, not a proven current-source parser leak. Do not invent `cmd` from preamble text. Still require rebuilt/installed app and raw direct/gateway/tunnel SSE proof before public closure.
- Boundary: source/unit proof only. Gemma4 QAT audio semantic live proof, installed-app/UI parity, full Responses streaming parity, and release readiness remain open.

# 2026-06-09 upstream MLX runtime intake and pinned compatibility patches

- Blockers reduced: #190/#191/#192 cross-model runtime/tool/cache/template issues and LFM/Gemma4 source compatibility.
- Upstream checked: recent `mlx-lm` and `mlx-vlm` PRs for BatchRotatingKVCache meta-state, LFM2 MoE routing, Gemma4 thinking detection, `<tool_call` marker merge, EOS-closed tools, OpenAI argument strings, APC disk promotion, Gemma4 shared-KV load, Qwen quantized KV, and MTP prefill.
- Source fix: added `vmlx_engine/runtime_patches/mlx_lm_compat.py`, auto-installed from `runtime_patches/__init__.py`, to backport three confirmed local `mlx_lm` gaps: BatchRotatingKVCache string-bool `meta_state`, LFM2 sigmoid MoE routing with `routed_scaling_factor`, and Gemma4 channel-thinking detection skip when `<|think|>` is present.
- Source fix carried from in-flight audio edit: Gemma4 audio placeholders are inserted before `<turn|>` as well as the older turn terminators.
- Proof-map fix: runtime patch source and tests are now included in current-suite, packaged-integrity, installed-app parity, release-gate, and JANG compatibility source-hash boundaries; focused current-suite pytest includes `tests/test_mlx_lm_runtime_patches.py`.
- Handoff doc: `docs/internal/UPSTREAM_MLX_RUNTIME_INTAKE_2026_06_09.md` lists implemented patches, checked-but-not-ported upstream PRs, and other-agent warnings.
- Boundary: source/no-heavy only. No package, signing, notarization, tag, download, or release action. LFM/Gemma4/Qwen/DSV4/Responses still need their live and installed-app proof rows before closure.

# 2026-06-09 03:42 PDT - Gemma QAT downloads and inventory row correction

- Blocker reduced: Gemma QAT/native MXFP4 model availability and release-gate accuracy for later live multiturn/tool/cache/media proof.
- Downloaded from JANGQ-AI to `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ-AI`: `gemma-4-E2B-it-qat-MXFP4` (3.8G), `gemma-4-E4B-it-qat-MXFP4` (5.6G), `gemma-4-12B-it-qat-MXFP4` (7.4G), `gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-qat-MXFP4` (15G), and `gemma-4-31B-it-qat-MXFP4` (18G).
- Root-cause/proof-gate correction: the inventory gate had stale Gemma3n E2B/E4B row assumptions. Actual JANGQ-AI QAT repos are Gemma4 configs with Gemma4 tool/reasoning parsers, so the row IDs/checks now use `gemma4_e2b_qat_native_mxfp4` and `gemma4_e4b_qat_native_mxfp4`.
- Tightened 12B/26B/31B QAT matching to require `qat` + `mxfp4`, so older JANG/MTP or non-QAT MXFP rows cannot satisfy the new QAT release rows.
- Refreshed inventory artifact: `build/current-gemma-qat-native-mxfp4-local-inventory-20260609.json`, `status=open`, `missing_required_rows=[]`, open rows are exactly the five downloaded QAT rows.
- Boundary: no model load and no release claim in this slice. Next proof must live-test coherency, multiturn recall, required/auto tools, parser leaks, Responses streaming/content/tool-arg events, generation defaults, mixed-SWA cache telemetry, block L2/fresh restore, vision/audio/video as advertised, UI/CLI parity, and installed-app startup.

## CODEX - 2026-06-09 Gemma QAT inventory row normalization verification
- Continued from the other-agent Gemma QAT inventory edit without reverting it.
- Added regression `test_gate_uses_gemma4_e2b_e4b_row_ids_for_gemma4_qat_bundles`; it failed first against stale `gemma3n_*` row IDs, then passed after normalizing row/check names.
- Full checklist consumers now check `gemma_qat_native_mxfp4_gemma4_e2b_present` and `gemma_qat_native_mxfp4_gemma4_e4b_present`; stale Gemma3n failure names are gone from the Gemma QAT gate.
- Refreshed inventory artifact: `build/current-gemma-qat-native-mxfp4-local-inventory-20260609.json`, `status=open`, `count=16`, `missing_required_rows=[]`, open rows exactly `gemma4_e2b_qat_native_mxfp4`, `gemma4_e4b_qat_native_mxfp4`, `gemma4_12b_native_mxfp4`, `gemma4_26b_vl`, and `gemma4_31v_or_31b_vl`.
- Full checklist runner generated `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-gemma-qat-inventory-row-correction-20260609.json`, still `status=open`, `failed_count=130`; this is expected and is not release clearance.
- Verification: Gemma inventory/checklist focused tests passed `4/4`; current-suite Gemma proof-map tests passed `3/3`; release-manifest source-hash mirror tests passed `2/2`; py_compile and `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: no Gemma model load, no installed-app proof, no package/sign/notarize/release. These rows remain open until live model/API/UI/cache/media proof exists.

## CODEX - 2026-06-09 Gemma4 QAT MXFP4 PLE loader fix
- Blocker reduced: #191 Gemma4 E2B QAT/native MXFP4 load/runtime path. Initial local smoke had failed load with `jang_loader Gemma4 PLE dequant: failed to find a valid bit-width for language_model.model.per_layer_model_projection.weight (shape=(8960, 192), scales=(8960, 48))`.
- Reproduced tensor truth from `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ-AI/gemma-4-E2B-it-qat-MXFP4`: `per_layer_model_projection.weight` is `uint32 (8960,192)`, scales are `uint8 (8960,48)`, and `embed_tokens_per_layer` is also native MXFP4 with weight/scales split across shards.
- Source fix: `vmlx_engine/utils/jang_loader.py` now distinguishes plain Gemma PLE modules from already-quantized `QuantizedLinear`/`QuantizedEmbedding` modules. Plain modules use native MXFP4/MXFP8 dequant, while quantized modules preserve packed `uint32` weights plus `uint8` scales and configure `mode/bits/group_size` instead of replacing the weight with `float16`.
- Regressions added: `test_gemma4_qat_mxfp4_ple_dequant_uses_mxfp_mode` and `test_gemma4_qat_mxfp4_quantized_ple_stays_packed`; model-artifact-format contract now requires both markers.
- Proof artifact: `build/current-model-artifact-format-contract-after-gemma4-qat-mxfp4-ple-preserve-20260609.json`, `status=pass`, `missing_markers=[]`, `model_artifact_format_pytest rc=0 passed=175 deselected=192`.
- Live E2B rerun: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-e2b-qat-mxfp4-tools-image-after-quantized-ple-preserve-20260609/JANGQ_gemma-4-E2B-it-qat-MXFP4/result.json` now loads and serves; text cache, multiturn, reasoning, required tool, JSON/code, and image probes run HTTP 200. Remaining single failure is `tool_result_continuation` exact expected summary: model returned `STORED blue-cat` while harness expected `STORED blue-cat.`.
- Boundary: no installed-app/UI proof, no E4B/12B/26B/31B live proof, no release/sign/notarize/package action. Gemma QAT rows remain open until the remaining exactness row plus full API/UI/cache/media/installed-app surfaces are green or honestly scoped.

## CODEX - 2026-06-09 native MXFP post-load scale guard
- Continued from a concurrent loader edit without reverting it.
- Source fix: `_fix_quantized_bits()` now treats `uint8` scales on quantized modules as native MXFP scale metadata and sets `mode=mxfp4/mxfp8`, `bits`, and `group_size=32` before the affine shape heuristic can reinterpret the module.
- Regression added: `test_native_mxfp_uint8_scales_select_mxfp_kernel`; model-artifact-format contract now requires this marker.
- Proof artifact: `build/current-model-artifact-format-contract-after-native-mxfp-scale-preserve-20260609.json`, `status=pass`, `missing_markers=[]`, `model_artifact_format_pytest rc=0 passed=176 deselected=192`.
- Boundary: source/no-heavy guard only. No new Gemma live row was cleared beyond the E2B partial smoke above; no release/sign/notarize/package action.

## CODEX - 2026-06-09 Gemma4 E4B QAT partial live proof
- Ran narrow current-source smoke for `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ-AI/gemma-4-E4B-it-qat-MXFP4` after the native MXFP loader fixes.
- Artifact: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-e4b-qat-mxfp4-tools-image-after-native-mxfp-scale-preserve-20260609/JANGQ_gemma-4-E4B-it-qat-MXFP4/result.json`, `status=probe_failed`, one failure.
- Result: E4B loads and serves; server log preserves quantized Gemma4 PLE for `embed_tokens_per_layer` and `per_layer_model_projection` with `mode=mxfp4`, `bits=4`, `gs=32`. No `quantized_matmul` runtime crash reproduced.
- Remaining failure matches E2B: `tool_result_continuation` returned `STORED blue-cat` while the harness expected `STORED blue-cat.`.
- Boundary: E4B remains not release-cleared; this is partial live proof only. No release/sign/notarize/package action.

## CODEX - 2026-06-09 Gemma4 MoE MXFP expert split and 26B boundary
- Continued from a concurrent loader edit without reverting it.
- Source fix: Gemma4 MoE native-MXFP expert tensors stored as fused packed `experts.gate_up_proj` and `experts.down_proj` now dequantize and map to runtime `experts.switch_glu.{gate,up,down}_proj.weight` float weights before `strict=False` load can silently ignore them.
- Regression added: `test_gemma4_moe_mxfp_experts_split_to_switch_glu_float_weights`; model-artifact-format contract now requires this marker.
- Proof artifact: `build/current-model-artifact-format-contract-after-gemma4-moe-mxfp-expert-split-20260609.json`, `status=pass`, `missing_markers=[]`, `model_artifact_format_pytest rc=0 passed=177 deselected=192`.
- Live 26B A4B QAT smoke: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-26b-a4b-qat-mxfp4-tools-image-after-moe-mxfp-expert-split-20260609/JANGQ_gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-qat-MXFP4/result.json`, `status=probe_failed`, `failures=24`.
- 26B boundary: model loaded, then first text prefill terminated the server with Metal OOM: `[METAL] Command buffer execution failed: Insufficient Memory`; server baseline was about `53.8GB` active with tight-memory allocator drain. Treat this as memory/preflight boundary, not release clearance.
- Boundary: no release/sign/notarize/package action. 26B remains open for memory-safe live proof.

## CODEX - 2026-06-09 Gemma4 12B QAT partial live proof
- Ran narrow current-source smoke for `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ-AI/gemma-4-12B-it-qat-MXFP4` after native MXFP loader fixes.
- Artifact: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-12b-qat-mxfp4-tools-image-after-native-mxfp-fixes-20260609/JANGQ_gemma-4-12B-it-qat-MXFP4/result.json`, `status=probe_failed`, one failure.
- Result: 12B loads and serves as `gemma4_unified`; text/cache/tool/image probes run HTTP 200. No direct-import startup failure, PLE crash, or `quantized_matmul` runtime crash reproduced.
- Remaining failure matches E2B/E4B: `tool_result_continuation` returned `STORED blue-cat` while the harness expected `STORED blue-cat.`.
- Boundary: 12B remains not release-cleared; this is partial live proof only. No release/sign/notarize/package action.

## CODEX - 2026-06-09 Gemma4 31B QAT partial live proof
- Ran narrow current-source smoke for `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ-AI/gemma-4-31B-it-qat-MXFP4` after native MXFP loader fixes.
- Artifact: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-31b-qat-mxfp4-tools-image-after-native-mxfp-fixes-20260609/JANGQ_gemma-4-31B-it-qat-MXFP4/result.json`, `status=probe_failed`, one failure.
- Result: 31B loads and serves; text/cache/tool/image probes run HTTP 200. No loader crash, Metal OOM, or `quantized_matmul` runtime crash reproduced in this narrow row.
- Remaining failure matches E2B/E4B/12B: `tool_result_continuation` returned `STORED blue-cat` while the harness expected `STORED blue-cat.`.
- Boundary: 31B remains not release-cleared; this is partial live proof only. No release/sign/notarize/package action.

## CODEX - 2026-06-09 04:58 PDT Gemma4 upstream video processor kwargs patch
- Blocker reduced: #191/#188 Gemma4 QAT/native MXFP4 `media` loader/processor path.
- Upstream mapped: `mlx-vlm` PR #1321, where real HF `video_processor` config keys can make Gemma4 processor construction fail before image/video inputs are handled.
- Local repro: pinned `mlx_vlm.models.gemma4.processing_gemma4.Gemma4VideoProcessor.__init__` has no `**kwargs`; the new regression failed before a vMLX `mlx_vlm_compat` installer existed.
- Source fix: added `vmlx_engine/runtime_patches/mlx_vlm_compat.py` and bootstrapped it from `runtime_patches/__init__.py`; the patch filters unknown HF video processor keys such as `do_convert_rgb`, `do_sample_frames`, `resample`, and `return_metadata` while preserving accepted Gemma4 video settings.
- Proof-map fix: `mlx_vlm_compat.py` is included in current-suite, installed-app parity, packaged-integrity, JANG compatibility, release-gate, and bundled-python source-hash boundaries.
- Verification: `tests/test_mlx_lm_runtime_patches.py` passed `5/5`; focused current-suite/install/release hash guard set passed `10/10`.
- Latest upstream checked for handoff: `mlx-lm` #1377 is error-message-only; `mlx-lm` #1327 short-prompt think-token clamp needs local tokenizer/server repro; `mlx-vlm` #1332 Qwen3-VL deepstack chunked-prefill alignment and `mlx-vlm` #1328 LFM2.5 VL loading are relevant candidates but must be locally mapped before porting.
- Boundary: no live Gemma media row, installed-app proof, package, signing, notarization, tag, download, or release claim from this slice.

## CODEX - 2026-06-09 Gemma4 QAT E2B/E4B/12B smoke harness exact-target proof
- Blocker reduced: Gemma4 QAT/native MXFP4 source live smokes for E2B, E4B, and 12B.
- Root cause: the tool-result continuation prompt left `STORED blue-cat.` unquoted, so Gemma4 could treat the final dot as sentence punctuation. Direct A/B showed quoted literal targets preserve the period.
- Source/proof-harness fix: `bench/all_local_model_smoke.py` now quotes the exact target string and explicitly says the final period is part of the literal. `validate_probe_response` still requires `STORED blue-cat.` exactly.
- Regression: `tests/test_all_local_model_smoke.py::test_tool_result_continuation_payload_quotes_exact_target_sentence`.
- Live proof:
  - `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-e2b-qat-mxfp4-fullmedia-tools-l2-after-tool-result-quoted-target-20260609/summary.json` => `status=pass`, `failures=0`.
  - `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-e4b-qat-mxfp4-fullmedia-tools-l2-after-tool-result-quoted-target-20260609/summary.json` => `status=pass`, `failures=0`.
  - `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-12b-qat-mxfp4-fullmedia-tools-l2-after-tool-result-quoted-target-20260609/summary.json` => `status=pass`, `failures=0`.
- Boundary: no installed-app/UI/tunnel/package/sign/notarize/release claim. 26B/31B, Responses raw SSE parity, MiniMax language/cache issue, MiMo/N2/DSV4 rows, and UI/CLI parity remain open.

## CODEX - 2026-06-09 Gemma4 QAT 26B/31B audio capability gate and source smoke pass
- Blocker reduced: old Gemma4 26B QAT incoherent multilingual/token-soup report plus 26B/31B stale audio scheduling.
- Source fix: `_bundle_declares_native_audio()` no longer treats Gemma4 `audio_token_id` as runtime audio support. Native Gemma4 audio now requires `config.audio_config` plus `audio_tower.*` weights. This keeps 26B/31B honest because their local indexes have zero audio tower keys.
- Capability proof: 26B and 31B `/capabilities` now report `modalities=["text","vision","video"]` and `media.status_by_modality.audio="not_advertised"`.
- Live proof:
  - `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-26b-qat-mxfp4-tools-l2-after-audio-capability-gate-20260609/summary.json` => `status=pass`, `failed=0`.
  - `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-31b-qat-mxfp4-tools-l2-after-audio-capability-gate-20260609/summary.json` => `status=pass`, `failed=0`.
- Cleared source surfaces: text coherency, reasoning-on visible final, multi-turn recall, required tool call, tool-result continuation, structured JSON, exact code whitespace, image, video, post-media text recovery, and block-disk L2 restart path.
- Boundary: no installed-app/UI/tunnel/package/sign/notarize/release claim. Responses raw SSE parity, MiniMax language/cache isolation, MiMo/N2/DSV4 rows, and UI/CLI parity remain open.

## CODEX - 2026-06-09 Responses direct Gemma4 SSE tool args parser fix
- Blocker reduced: #190/#192 direct local Responses SSE argument streaming for Gemma4 native tool syntax.
- Root cause: Gemma4 E2B QAT emitted a complete native call at end of output without the closing `<tool_call|>` marker: `<|tool_call>call:record_fact{value:<|"|>blue-cat<|"|>}`. The parser required the end marker, so the stream produced reasoning/heartbeat events but no parsed `function_call` or `response.function_call_arguments.*`.
- Source fix: `Gemma4ToolParser` now accepts complete no-end-marker calls only at end-of-output with a closed argument brace. Partial native calls still fail closed.
- Regression: `tests/test_gemma4_tool_parser.py::TestGemma4ToolParser::test_native_format_complete_call_at_end_without_end_marker`.
- Direct proof: `build/current-responses-raw-sse-parity-direct-gemma4-e2b-after-parser-20260609.json` has direct capture present, parse errors `0`, `argument_delta_count=2`, `argument_done_count=1`, `function_name=record_fact`, authoritative args `{"value": "blue-cat"}`.
- Boundary: artifact remains `status=open` because gateway and tunnel captures are missing. Do not close #190/#192 or release from direct proof only.

## CODEX - 2026-06-09 Responses panel gateway Gemma4 SSE tool args proof
- Blocker reduced: #190/#192 local panel gateway raw SSE parity for Gemma4 Responses function-call args.
- Method: temporary Vitest gateway instance with mocked sessions routed to a real current-source vMLX backend serving Gemma4 E2B QAT. The temp test file was removed after capture; no permanent harness was added.
- Proof: `build/current-responses-raw-sse-parity-direct-gateway-gemma4-e2b-after-parser-20260609.json` has direct and gateway captures present, parse errors `0`, `argument_delta_count=2`, `argument_done_count=1`, expected args match, and authoritative args `{"value": "blue-cat"}` on both surfaces.
- Boundary: artifact remains `status=open` because public tunnel capture is missing. Local direct server and local panel gateway are proven for this request shape; do not claim tunnel/download/release parity yet.

## CODEX - 2026-06-09 Responses raw SSE parity strict expected-args gate
- Blocker reduced: #190/#192 Responses direct/gateway/tunnel raw SSE proof quality.
- Source fix: `tests/cross_matrix/run_responses_raw_sse_parity_contract.py` now supports expected function name, expected authoritative arguments, parse-clean checks, and `--require-reasoning-events`.
- Current-suite default: raw SSE parity now requires function `lookup`, authoritative arguments `{"query":"alpha"}`, and reasoning summary events so a no-reasoning-disable workaround cannot satisfy the row.
- Regenerated artifact: `build/current-responses-raw-sse-parity-20260609.json`, still `status=open`, `missing_captures=[direct,gateway,tunnel]`, with the stricter expected block recorded.
- Validation: parity classifier tests plus current-suite marker guard passed `7/7`; no live vMLX model/gateway/tunnel listeners were available in this slice.
- Boundary: not issue closure. Need real raw SSE captures across direct local server, panel gateway, and tunnel with matching expected args and reasoning events.

## CODEX - 2026-06-09 Gemma4 audio capability requires tower weights
- Blocker reduced: Gemma4 QAT/native MXFP4 advertised `media` honesty for 12B/26B/31B-style bundles.
- Source fix: `_bundle_declares_native_audio()` now requires `model_type=gemma4` bundles to have both `audio_config` and actual `audio_tower.*` entries in `model.safetensors.index.json` before advertising audio. Token-only `audio_token_id` metadata no longer exposes audio capability for this family.
- Proof: focused runtime modality tests passed `3/3`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: capability honesty only. This does not claim live Gemma4 audio semantic quality, installed-app parity, package, signing, notarization, tag, download, or release readiness.

## CODEX - 2026-06-09 mlx-lm short-prompt tokenizer bounds patch
- Blocker reduced: upstream MLX runtime intake / thinking-template short-prompt crash class relevant to MiniMax/Qwen/DSV4-style thinking prompts.
- Upstream mapped: `mlx-lm` issue #1326 / PR #1327. Pinned local `TokenizerWrapper._find()` still accepted negative `start` and could walk wrapped Python indexes when callers search from `len(prompt)-11` on very short prompts.
- Source fix: `vmlx_engine/runtime_patches/mlx_lm_compat.py` now clamps `_find()` start/end bounds and returns `-1` for empty sequences or search windows shorter than the target sequence. Runtime patch is installed through existing `vmlx_engine.runtime_patches` bootstrap.
- Proof: `tests/test_mlx_lm_runtime_patches.py` passed `6/6`; direct probe reports `short_negative_reverse=-1`, `short_negative_found=0`, and patched marker true; current-suite source hash checks passed `2/2`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Commit: `b2f05a4e` pushed to `origin/main` and `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- Boundary: source/runtime compatibility fix only. No model-family release clearance, no installed-app proof, no package/sign/notarize/tag/download action.

# 2026-06-09 05:23 PDT - MiniMax bare invoke parser and live cache smoke

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx` work.
- Root cause from live MiniMax Small JANGTQ proof: `tool_required` generated a complete native MiniMax invoke block, `<invoke name="record_fact"><parameter name="value">blue-cat</parameter></invoke>`, without the outer `<minimax:tool_call>` wrapper. The runtime parser previously ignored that shape and the server returned HTTP 400 for required tool choice.
- Fix: `vmlx_engine/tool_parsers/minimax_tool_parser.py` now parses complete bare `<invoke>...</invoke>` blocks using the existing MiniMax parameter parser. It does not accept truncated bare invoke fragments; lenient truncated parsing remains scoped to native wrapped `<minimax:tool_call>` blocks.
- Regression: `tests/test_tool_parsers.py::TestMiniMaxToolParser::test_bare_invoke_parameter_block` covers the exact live output shape.
- Verification:
  - `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile vmlx_engine/tool_parsers/minimax_tool_parser.py tests/test_tool_parsers.py` -> pass.
  - `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_tool_parsers.py -k MiniMax` -> `20 passed`.
  - Live source smoke: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-minimax-small-jangtq-cache-language-after-bare-invoke-tool-20260609/summary.json` -> `status=pass`, `failures=0` for `MiniMax-M2.7-Small-JANGTQ` with tools, cache repeat, multiturn recall, reasoning, structured JSON, exact code whitespace, and L2 restart enabled.
- Boundary: this clears the current-source MiniMax Small JANGTQ bare-invoke tool parser failure. It does not clear reporter parity, public installed/downloaded app parity, or the broader random Chinese/visible planning isolation row; those remain active release blockers.

## CODEX - 2026-06-09 Gemma4 upstream unified/shared-KV runtime intake
- Blocker reduced: #188/#191 Gemma4 loader/runtime compatibility for upstream MLX Gemma4 Unified and KV-shared checkpoint shapes.
- Upstream mapped from current repos:
  - `mlx-lm` PR #1349: `gemma4_unified` text-runtime remap plus `vision_embedder.*` sanitize skip.
  - `mlx-vlm` PR #1301: Gemma4 `num_kv_shared_layers` must avoid allocating unused K/V modules and must filter stale shared-layer K/V weights.
- Source fix:
  - `vmlx_engine/runtime_patches/mlx_lm_compat.py` maps `gemma4_unified` to `gemma4` and strips encoder-free `vision_embedder.*` weights before Gemma4 text sanitize.
  - `vmlx_engine/runtime_patches/mlx_vlm_compat.py` marks Gemma4 shared-KV layers as `kv_shared_only`, removes unused `k_proj`/`v_proj`/`k_norm`/`v_norm` modules, and filters stale shared K/V weights in both outer and language sanitize paths.
- Handoff doc updated: `docs/internal/UPSTREAM_MLX_RUNTIME_INTAKE_2026_06_09.md` now lists those two implemented backports and records checked/no-patch items for `mlx-lm` PR #1167 and PR #1347.
- Verification:
  - `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_mlx_lm_runtime_patches.py` -> `8 passed`.
  - Current-suite source-hash/release-manifest mirror slice -> `2 passed`.
  - `py_compile` and `git diff --check` -> pass.
- Boundary: source/no-heavy compatibility only. No heavy Gemma live rerun, no installed-app/UI proof, no package/sign/notarize/tag/download/release action. Keep full Gemma4 QAT/native MXFP4 matrix and installed-app parity open.

# 2026-06-09 05:34 PDT - Responses public tunnel available-model SSE proof

- Endpoint probed: `https://testapi.adlabus.dev/v1/responses`.
- Same-model Gemma4 E2B parity is still open because the tunnel does not advertise `gemma4-e2b-sse` and returned `model_not_found` with its current available model list.
- Available Gemma4 12B MXFP8 capture is also not usable yet because the tunnel returned `model_load_timeout` before streaming.
- Available-model tunnel proof: `models/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-MXFP8-CRACK-MTP` streamed a required `record_fact` Responses tool call through the public tunnel with reasoning enabled.
- Raw SSE: `build/responses-sse-captures-20260609/tunnel-qwen35-mxfp8-mtp-tool-20260609.sse`.
- Classifier artifact: `build/current-responses-public-tunnel-available-model-sse-proof-20260609.json`.
- Result: `argument_delta_count=2`, `argument_done_count=1`, `authoritative_arguments={"value": "blue-cat"}`, `parse_errors=0`, and visible tunnel heartbeats/reasoning did not prevent argument streaming.
- Boundary: this proves the public tunnel is not generally stripping `response.function_call_arguments.delta/done` events. It does not close same-model direct/gateway/tunnel parity because the tunnel model set differs from the local Gemma4 E2B proof model.

# 2026-06-09 - Responses tool parser candidate preference

- Component fix in `vmlx_engine/server.py`: Responses finalization now tries separated content, separated reasoning, stripped full text, and full text as real parser candidates, then prefers the first parsed tool call set with non-empty arguments.
- Root issue addressed: reasoning-enabled models can accumulate native tool syntax outside the content candidate; parsing only content first can miss real arguments or let an empty-argument candidate win.
- Boundary: no arguments are synthesized from visible text or reasoning prose. Missing required XML/JSON args still fail closed through the existing required-tool path.
- Validation: `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile vmlx_engine/server.py` passed; `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_server.py -k "Responses and function_call_arguments or streaming_responses_tool_call"` passed `2/2`; `git diff --check -- vmlx_engine/server.py` passed.

# 2026-06-09 - Responses output-index parity contract and current-source boundary

- Preserved and committed the Responses raw-SSE parity classifier update as `50923a7d` (`Track Responses output item index parity`) on `origin/main` and `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- Contract now flags any surface where `function_call` output items reuse a message/reasoning `output_index`; this matches the public tunnel Qwen35 capture shape where args streamed but the function item reused index `0`.
- Validation: `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile tests/cross_matrix/run_responses_raw_sse_parity_contract.py tests/test_responses_raw_sse_parity_contract.py` passed; `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_responses_raw_sse_parity_contract.py` passed `8/8`.
- Current source server boundary: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_server.py -k "streaming_responses_tool_call_uses_next_output_index_without_text or streaming_responses_reasoning_tool_call_keeps_arguments"` passed `2/2`, proving current source emits function-call and argument events on the next output index for the focused unit path and keeps reasoning-channel tool arguments.
- Boundary: same-model direct/gateway/tunnel parity still needs a comparable deployed tunnel model. The public tunnel available-model proof shows argument events are not generally stripped, but it also exposes stale/deployed output-index behavior that current source already guards against.

# 2026-06-09 - Responses raw SSE same-model parity guard

- Preserved and committed the follow-up classifier update as `56e9750e` (`Require same model for Responses SSE parity`) on `origin/main` and `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- Contract now requires all supplied direct/gateway/tunnel raw SSE surfaces to report the same model before a parity artifact can pass; this prevents a Qwen tunnel proof from closing a Gemma4 direct/gateway row.
- Diagnostic artifact: `build/current-responses-raw-sse-parity-mixed-model-tunnel-output-index-20260609.json`, `status=fail`.
- Evidence: direct/gateway Gemma4 E2B captures preserve `record_fact` args and valid output indices; public tunnel Qwen35 MXFP8 MTP preserves `{"value":"blue-cat"}` args, but is not the same model and reuses `output_index=0` for both message and function_call.
- Boundary: not issue closure. Need same-model direct local, panel gateway, and tunnel raw SSE captures with matching args, reasoning events, parse-clean SSE, and valid output item indices.

# 2026-06-09 - N2 JANGTQ2 live chat/cache/Responses proof

- Ran existing live gate, no source-vs-quant comparison: `.venv/bin/python tests/cross_matrix/run_n2_chat_cache_gate.py --port 8894 --include-responses-probe --include-responses-stream-probe --out build/current-n2-jangtq2-chat-cache-responses-proof-after-responses-parser-20260609.json --cache-dir build/current-n2-jangtq2-chat-cache-responses-proof-block-cache-20260609`.
- Result: artifact `status=pass` for `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/Nex-N2-Pro-JANGTQ2`.
- Covered rows: chat no-cache/warm/cache-hit all returned `ACK`; chat cache hit reported `cached_tokens=8`, `cache_detail=paged+ssm`; Responses required tool returned `function_call_arguments=[{"query":"alpha"}]`; Responses tool follow-up returned visible `DONE`; streaming Responses required tool returned `function_call_arguments=[{"query":"alpha"}]`, `argument_delta_text_by_item={...: "{\"query\": \"alpha\"}"}`, `cached_tokens=192`, `cache_detail=paged+ssm`.
- Runtime evidence in server log: model family `qwen3_5_moe`, `reasoning_parser=qwen3`, `tool_parser=qwen`, JANGTQ VLM fast path, P3/P15/P17/P18 kernels, TurboQuant enabled, runtime cache layout with TurboQuantKVCache attention layers and native SSM companion state, VLM paged cache, VLM block-disk cache, hybrid SSM L2, q4 KV storage, paged cache hits, KV+SSM cache hits, and TurboQuant recompression before cache reuse.
- Boundary: this clears the current-source N2 JANGTQ2 narrow live cache/tool/Responses row. It does not clear installed-app UI parity, media/VL semantic rows, same-model public tunnel parity, DSV4, MiMo, package integrity, signing, notarization, or release readiness.

# 2026-06-09 - Qwen3-VL chunked-prefill deepstack alignment

- Upstream intake implemented: `mlx-vlm` PR #1332 for Qwen3-VL / Qwen3-VL-MoE chunked-prefill visual detail loss.
- Local pinned gap: `LanguageModel.__call__` sliced `visual_pos_masks` from `n_to_process` but forwarded the full `deepstack_visual_embeds` list to every chunk, and left the mask longer than the current input window.
- Source fix: `vmlx_engine/runtime_patches/mlx_vlm_compat.py` now realigns both `visual_pos_masks` and `deepstack_visual_embeds` to the current single-sequence chunk window for Qwen3-VL and Qwen3-VL-MoE.
- Proof: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_mlx_lm_runtime_patches.py -k qwen3_vl_chunked_prefill` passed `1/1`.
- Boundary: source/no-heavy runtime shim only. This does not clear live Qwen VL OCR/video quality, batched continuous prefill, installed-app/UI parity, package/sign/notarize/tag/download, or release readiness.

# 2026-06-09 - LFM2.5 VL projector layernorm loading

- Upstream intake implemented: `mlx-vlm` PR #1328 for LFM2.5-VL mlx-format projector loading.
- Local pinned gap: disabled projector layernorm was represented as `nn.Identity`, so checkpoints with `multi_modal_projector.layer_norm.*` keys can miss/unexpected-load those weights even though `projector_use_layernorm` should control use, not module materialization.
- Source fix: `vmlx_engine/runtime_patches/mlx_vlm_compat.py` now always materializes the projector `LayerNorm` for LFM2.5-VL load compatibility and skips applying it when `projector_use_layernorm=false`.
- Proof: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_mlx_lm_runtime_patches.py -k lfm25_vl_projector` passed `1/1`.
- Boundary: source/no-heavy load shim only. This does not clear live LFM2.5 VL media quality, text/tool exactness, installed-app/UI parity, package/sign/notarize/tag/download, or release readiness.

# 2026-06-09 - N2 chat/cache memory preflight unit labels

- Source/proof-harness fix: `tests/cross_matrix/run_n2_chat_cache_gate.py` now labels psutil memory snapshots and skip artifacts with `unit="GiB"`, `available_gib`, `total_gib`, `required_available_gib`, and `memory_gap_gib`, while preserving legacy `*_gb` aliases for existing consumers.
- Refreshed no-launch artifact: `build/current-n2-chat-cache-memory-preflight-after-unit-label-20260609.json`.
- Result: `status=skipped`, `reason=insufficient_available_memory`, `unit=GiB`, `available_gib=98.08`, `required_available_gib=120.0`, `memory_gap_gib=21.92`.
- Validation: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_n2_chat_cache_gate.py` passed `9/9`; focused current-suite source-hash row passed; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: proof-harness/preflight interpretation only. No N2 model launch, no N2 JANG_1L clearance, no installed-app/UI parity, no package/sign/notarize/tag/download, and no release action.

# 2026-06-09 - Hybrid SSM L2 prefix restore after restart

- Other-agent edit inspected and preserved: restarted `SSMCompanionCache` instances can now discover persisted SSM checkpoint lengths from `SSMCompanionDiskStore` even when the in-memory length index is empty.
- Source fix: `SSMCompanionDiskStore.candidate_lengths(max_len)` reads sidecar `num_tokens` metadata; `SSMCompanionCache.fetch_longest_prefix()` falls back to those persisted lengths and then delegates to normal `fetch()` so deep-copy and telemetry behavior stay uniform.
- Regression: `tests/test_ssm_companion_cache.py::test_disk_store_restores_longest_prefix_after_cache_recreation`.
- Proof artifact: `build/current-cache-architecture-contract-after-ssm-l2-prefix-restore-20260609.json`, `status=pass`, `failed=[]`, `missing_markers=[]`; cache-family pytest selected `429` rows.
- Validation: full `tests/test_ssm_companion_cache.py` passed `52/52`; `tests/test_cache_architecture_contract.py -k "hybrid_ssm or cache_architecture"` passed `7/7`; focused current-suite cache/source-hash slice passed; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: source/no-heavy hybrid SSM L2 restore proof only. It does not clear live N2 JANG_1L, DSV4, MiMo, installed-app/UI parity, package/sign/notarize/tag/download, or release readiness.

# 2026-06-09 - Gemma QAT inventory refresh after N2 proof

- Refreshed the no-heavy Gemma QAT/native MXFP4 inventory gate: `.venv/bin/python tests/cross_matrix/run_gemma_qat_native_mxfp4_inventory_gate.py --out build/current-gemma-qat-native-mxfp4-local-inventory-after-n2-proof-20260609.json`.
- Result: `status=open`, `count=16`, `missing_required_rows=[]`, required open rows remain `gemma4_e2b_qat_native_mxfp4`, `gemma4_e4b_qat_native_mxfp4`, `gemma4_12b_native_mxfp4`, `gemma4_26b_vl`, and `gemma4_31v_or_31b_vl`.
- Boundary: inventory coverage is current and complete for required local Gemma QAT rows, but the row intentionally remains open until live media/cache/tool/UI/release proofs cover the full release matrix.

# 2026-06-09 - MiMo JANGTQ2 exactness isolation

- Ran current-source MiMo JANGTQ2 all-local smoke with tools and L2 restart: `VMLINUX_BENCH_ISOLATED=1 .venv/bin/python bench/all_local_model_smoke.py --models-root /Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models --only MiMo-V2.5-JANGTQ_2 --max-models 1 --port 8896 --load-timeout-s 600 --request-timeout-s 240 --include-tools --include-l2-restart --out build/current-all-local-model-smoke-mimo-v25-jangtq2-tools-l2-after-responses-n2-20260609`.
- Result: `status=probe_failed`, `failures=5`. Failures are exact sentinel mutation, not load/cache infrastructure: `tool_required` returned `blue-1` instead of `blue-cat`; `mimo_tool_required_sentinel` returned `B7CAT-09` instead of `B7-CAT-09`; tool-result continuation returned `STORED blue cat.`; JSON returned `blue-3` or `B7CAT-09` instead of exact expected values.
- Runtime infrastructure evidence from logs: JANGTQ native TurboQuant fast path loaded; MiMo affine SwitchGLU decode fast path installed; native mixed-SWA cache schema selected; generic TurboQuant KV skipped by design; paged cache and block-disk L2 write-through active; L2 restart server loaded existing disk blocks.
- Isolation run: served `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/MiMo-V2.5-JANGTQ_2` conservatively with `--no-continuous-batching --disable-prefix-cache --kv-cache-quantization none --disable-native-mtp`; artifact `build/current-mimo-v25-jangtq2-nocache-exactness-isolation-20260609.json`.
- Isolation result: exact prompt `blue-cat` -> `blue cat`; exact prompt `B7-CAT-09` -> `B7ACAT-09`; JSON expected `blue-cat` -> `blue`; required tool argument `blue-cat` -> `blue cat`. This reproduces exactness failure with prefix/paged/L2/KV quantization disabled.
- Classification: MiMo JANGTQ2 current-source cache and runtime infrastructure are not the immediate cause of sentinel mutation. Exactness/tool-argument failures persist in conservative no-cache decode, so release remains blocked for MiMo exact/tool rows. Do not fake-clear with JSON repair, parser rewriting, prompt folding, or cache guards.

# 2026-06-09 - Qwen3-VL chunked deepstack runtime patch accepted

- Inspected other-agent runtime patch and committed `2e989f81` (`Align Qwen3 VL chunked deepstack prefill`) to `origin/main` and `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- Runtime fix: `vmlx_engine/runtime_patches/mlx_vlm_compat.py` now patches `mlx_vlm.models.qwen3_vl.language.LanguageModel.__call__` and `mlx_vlm.models.qwen3_vl_moe.language.LanguageModel.__call__` so chunked prefill slices both `visual_pos_masks` and `deepstack_visual_embeds` to the current visual-token window.
- Scope: Qwen3-VL / Qwen3-VL-MoE visual/mRoPE chunked prefill compatibility. This is not a fake model behavior guard and does not synthesize outputs.
- Validation: `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile vmlx_engine/runtime_patches/mlx_vlm_compat.py tests/test_mlx_lm_runtime_patches.py` passed; focused patch tests passed `3/3`; full runtime patch suite passed `9/9`; focused current-suite pointer/hash row passed.
- Boundary: source/unit compatibility proof only. Full Qwen/N2/Gemma/MiMo media/UI installed-app matrix remains open until live model/UI proofs cover it.

# 2026-06-09 - Qwen27 hybrid SSM L2 restart restore fix

- Blocker reduced: `cache/storage` for Qwen3.6 27B/35B MTP hybrid SSM restart/L2 proof.
- Root cause: after restart, block KV L2 could restore the 56-token prefix while SSM companion L2 either had no restart-time length index or had evicted the matching SSM sidecar under an independent 2GB budget. That created KV-without-SSM fallback and correctly blocked `paged+ssm+disk` claims.
- Fix: `SSMCompanionDiskStore.candidate_lengths()` exposes persisted sidecar token lengths; `SSMCompanionCache.fetch_longest_prefix()` uses those lengths after restart while still requiring exact model/token/extra-key hashes; VLM scheduler now defaults SSM companion disk budget from configured SSM companion capacity when larger than block KV L2 budget, unless `VMLINUX_SSM_DISK_CACHE_MAX_GB` explicitly overrides.
- No fake behavior: no cache-hit telemetry relaxation, no parser rewrite, no forced output, no generic KV substitution for hybrid SSM.
- Unit proof: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_n2_chat_cache_gate.py tests/test_ssm_companion_cache.py` -> `61 passed`.
- Live proof: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-qwen36-27b-mxfp4-mtp-tools-l2-after-ssm-disk-budget-fix-20260609`, status `pass`, failures `0`; restart usage has `cached_tokens=56`, `cache_detail=paged+ssm+disk`, block disk `disk_hits=1`, SSM disk `hits=1`, `misses=0`, and no `hybrid_kv_without_ssm` fallback.
- Boundary: clears current-source Qwen3.6-27B MXFP4 MTP smoke/L2 row only. Installed-app UI parity, Qwen35 tunnel/deployed parity, and full release packaging remain open.

# 2026-06-09 - Issue #185 empty image LoRA scales source fix

- Source fix: `ImageGenEngine.load()` now treats empty `lora_paths=[]` and `lora_scales=[]` as the default no-LoRA path instead of requested LoRA, matching the CLI/server globals when no `--lora-*` flags are supplied.
- Preserved validation: non-empty `lora_scales` without paths still raises `--lora-scales requires --lora-paths`, length mismatch remains rejected, and requested LoRA is still refused for constructors that cannot accept LoRA args.
- Regression tests: `tests/test_image_gen.py::TestLoadMethod::test_load_treats_empty_lora_lists_as_no_lora_request` and `tests/test_image_gen.py::TestLoadMethod::test_load_rejects_nonempty_lora_scales_without_paths`.
- Proof artifact: `build/current-issue175-179-release-boundary-audit-after-issue185-empty-lora-fix-20260609.json`, `status=open`; issue 178 LoRA source checks pass with `empty_lora_lists_noop_regression_test_present=true` and `lora_scale_without_path_still_rejected=true`. The artifact stays open for unrelated installed/live rows.
- Validation: full `tests/test_image_gen.py` passed `75/75`; focused image API LoRA slice passed `3/3`; panel CLI LoRA contract passed `1/1`; full objective checklist passed `5/5`; focused current-suite/release-manifest slices passed; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: current-source/no-heavy fix only. No image model was launched, no app was rebuilt/installed, and no package/sign/notarize/tag/download/release action was taken.

# 2026-06-09 - Cross-architecture fix compatibility ledger

- User requirement: every runtime/parser/cache/media fix must be checked against other model architectures and quant formats before calling it release-safe. Do not assume a Gemma fix applies to Qwen/N2/MiMo/DSV4/LFM/Step, and do not assume a JANG fix applies to JANGTQ/MXFP4/MXFP8 or vice versa.
- Required per-fix cross-check dimensions:
  - model family: Gemma4/Gemma4 Unified, MiMo V2.5, N2/Qwen3.5/3.6, DSV4, Step3p7, LFM2.5, MiniMax, ZAYA, Nemotron/Nemo.
  - attention/cache architecture: full attention, mixed SWA, asymmetric SWA, hybrid SSM, DSV4 SWA/CSA/HCA, ZAYA CCA, media-expanded VLM prompt cache, native MTP cache, plain KV.
  - quant format/runtime: affine JANG, stacked JANG, JANGTQ/MXTQ, MXFP4 native/QAT, MXFP8, mixed sidecars, passthrough embeddings/lm_head, TurboQuant KV storage, live TurboQuant attention KV, block-disk L2.
  - API surface: Chat Completions, Responses nonstream/stream, Responses function_call_arguments delta/done, previous_response_id, Anthropic, Ollama, cancellation, cache endpoints.
  - UI/CLI surface: generated launch flags, parser/reasoning selection, cache toggles, max output/context, model-owned generation_config defaults, installed app parity.
  - media surface: image/audio/video advertised-vs-weight-backed capability, media-salted cache keys, post-media text recovery, no text-only fallback that hides missing waveform/video bridge.
- Current fix boundaries to preserve:
  - Hybrid SSM L2 restart fix is for hybrid VLM/cache families where block KV and SSM companion L2 must remain consistent. It must not be treated as generic KV proof, and it must be checked for N2/Qwen35/Qwen27/LFM-hybrid before release claims.
  - Responses tool-argument streaming fixes must remain parser-output based. Do not synthesize tool args from visible prose or disable reasoning as a workaround. Check Gemma/Qwen/MiniMax/Step/MiMo parser dialects separately.
  - Gemma4 QAT/native MXFP4 media capability must be weight-backed: E2B/E4B have real audio tower weights; 26B/31B do not. Token IDs alone must not schedule audio. Video must be proven by actual processor/runtime support, not token presence alone.
  - MiMo JANGTQ2 exactness failures currently show valid parser structure but wrong literal values. Do not fix by JSON repair, tool-argument rewrite, cache disabling, prompt-only formatting, or hidden sampling clamps. Treat as artifact/quantization/logit/runtime decode quality until stronger evidence says otherwise.
  - N2 JANGTQ2 source proof is green for chat/cache/Responses; N2 JANG_1L remains memory-gated. Do not claim N2 family release-clear from JANGTQ2 alone.
  - Gemma QAT inventory currently sees model rows and multiple live smokes, but full release still needs explicit proof mapping for all required surfaces and installed/UI parity. Do not conflate source smoke pass with package release readiness.
  - DSV4 must use native SWA/CSA/HCA composite cache. Do not substitute generic TurboQuant KV for DSV4 cache proof.
- Release rule: a fix can be marked family-wide only after either each architecture/quant/API/media surface has direct current proof, or the source code has a mechanically architecture-neutral contract plus tests/proofs covering representative plain KV, mixed SWA, hybrid SSM, and media-expanded VLM paths.

# 2026-06-09 - Gemma QAT source-smoke map and N2 L2 proof gate

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, Swift, ADLab, Max2, or transport work.
- Pushed `7e19117c` (`Track Gemma QAT source smokes and N2 L2 proof`) to `origin/main` and `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- Gemma QAT/native MXFP4 inventory now records source live-smoke proof paths for required E2B, E4B, 12B, 26B, and 31B/31V rows:
  - `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-e2b-qat-mxfp4-fullmedia-tools-l2-after-tool-result-quoted-target-20260609/summary.json`
  - `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-e4b-qat-mxfp4-fullmedia-tools-l2-after-tool-result-quoted-target-20260609/summary.json`
  - `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-12b-qat-mxfp4-fullmedia-tools-l2-after-tool-result-quoted-target-20260609/summary.json`
  - `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-26b-qat-mxfp4-tools-l2-after-audio-capability-gate-20260609/summary.json`
  - `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-31b-qat-mxfp4-tools-l2-after-audio-capability-gate-20260609/summary.json`
- Release checklist now exposes `gemma_qat_native_mxfp4_all_source_live_smokes_present` separately from `gemma_qat_native_mxfp4_all_live_proofs_present` so source-smoke progress cannot be mistaken for installed-app/release clearance.
- Refreshed artifact: `build/current-gemma-qat-native-mxfp4-local-inventory-after-source-smoke-map-20260609.json` has `status=open`, `missing_required_rows=[]`, `source_live_smoke_open_rows=[]`, but all required rows remain open for full media/cache/tool/Responses/UI/installed-app proof.
- Refreshed objective checklist: `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-gemma-qat-source-smoke-map-20260609.json` has `status=open`, `failed_count=116`; Gemma source-smoke row is green, release live-proof row remains red.
- N2 chat/cache gate now records which optional probes were requested for skipped runs and adds an explicit `--include-l2-restart-probe` path requiring a fresh-process cache hit with `cache_detail` containing `disk`, block-disk hits, and SSM companion disk hits.
- Validation: `py_compile` passed for the changed gate/checklist files; focused pytest `tests/test_n2_chat_cache_gate.py tests/test_gemma_qat_native_mxfp4_inventory_gate.py tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py` passed `21/21`; `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundaries: no package, signing, notarization, tag, download, or release action. MiMo exactness/media, N2 JANG_1L memory-safe live proof, Gemma full installed-app/UI/Responses/media matrix, DSV4 memory-gated live proof, MiniMax random-language/cache isolation, and package/sign/notarize remain open.

# 2026-06-09 - MiMo cache/no-cache memory telemetry and live refresh

- Blocker reduced: MiMo JANGTQ2 cache-vs-no-cache proof interpretation and stale status wording.
- Source/proof-harness fix: `tests/cross_matrix/run_mimo_v2_cache_vs_nocache_next_token.py` now labels psutil memory snapshots and preflight skip artifacts with `unit="GiB"`, `available_gib`, `total_gib`, `required_available_gib`, and `memory_gap_gib`, while preserving legacy `*_gb` fields. Intentional preflight skips now exit 0 like the N2 cache gate.
- Live proof refreshed: `build/current-mimo-v2-jangtq2-cache-vs-nocache-next-token-logprobs-after-unit-label-20260609.json`, `status=pass`; no-cache, warm-store, and cache-hit rows all emitted `ACK`; top10/logprob signatures matched; cache hit reported `cached_tokens=31`, `cache_detail=paged`; telemetry showed `before_launch 113.39 GiB`, `after_health 38.64 GiB`, `after_requests 38.52 GiB`.
- Runtime evidence: server log shows JANGTQ native TurboQuant fast path, MiMo affine SwitchGLU decode fast path, native mixed full/SWA cache layout, paged cache, block-disk write-through, and a paged cache hit for 31 tokens.
- Coordination boundary: this clears the current paged-cache/no-cache next-token proof row only. It does not clear MiMo literal/tool/JSON exactness, media E2E, JANG_2L full live media/L2, installed-app UI, or release readiness. Full JANG_2L launch was not attempted because the local bundle is about 105G on a 128 GiB host and still needs a separate safe memory gate.

# 2026-06-09 - N2 JANG_1L RAM boundary clarification

- User clarified that N2/JANG_1L should fit if RAM is handled carefully.
- Treat the N2/JANG_1L row as a careful-RAM live launch/proof scheduling problem, not as an impossible or permanently memory-blocked model.
- Do not do source-vs-quant or extra-heavy comparisons unless explicitly allowed; focus on one controlled live runtime proof with conservative settings, memory preflight, prefix/cache/tool/Responses/parser coverage, and clean shutdown.
- Current release boundary remains open until the actual JANG_1L live proof exists. Prior memory preflight artifacts are a launch-safety warning, not a final model infeasibility claim.

# 2026-06-09 - Responses raw-SSE release parity tracked in objective checklist

- Pushed `c27f1024` (`Track Responses raw SSE release parity`) to `origin/main` and `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest` on top of current remote tip `fb3bc58a`.
- Added `RESPONSES_RAW_SSE_PARITY` to the full release objective checklist, pointing at `build/current-responses-raw-sse-parity-direct-gateway-gemma4-e2b-after-parser-20260609.json`.
- New checklist group `responses_raw_sse_parity` explicitly checks direct, gateway, and tunnel captures; expected function name; expected authoritative arguments; parse cleanliness; cross-surface argument equality; and required reasoning events.
- Refreshed checklist artifact: `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-responses-raw-sse-gemma-surface-20260609.json` has `status=open`, `failed_count=119`.
- Current raw-SSE blocker is now visible in the objective checklist: direct and gateway Gemma4 E2B captures are green, but `responses_raw_sse_parity_tunnel_capture_present=false` and `responses_raw_sse_parity_all_required_surfaces_present` is red with `missing_captures=["tunnel"]`.
- Validation: new checklist tests failed before implementation, then focused raw-SSE/checklist tests passed `16/16`; `py_compile` passed; `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: this is a proof-map/release-gate visibility fix. It does not claim public tunnel parity, installed-app parity, package/sign/notarize/tag/download, or release readiness.

# 2026-06-09 - Current-suite pointer moved to raw-SSE-aware checklist

- Pushed `66ef200c` (`Use raw SSE checklist in current suite`) to `origin/main` and `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- Moved `run_full_release_objective_checklist.DEFAULT_OUT` and the current regression suite command/allow-open path from `current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-pr-intake-matrix-refresh-20260609.json` to `current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-responses-raw-sse-gemma-surface-20260609.json`.
- Validation: focused current-suite/checklist pointer tests passed `11/11`; `py_compile` passed; `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: this is proof-pointer sync only. It ensures umbrella gates consume the raw-SSE-aware checklist; it does not clear the missing public tunnel capture or release blockers.

# 2026-06-09 - MiMo cache proof memory-unit harness fix

- Pushed `8141929e` (`Label MiMo cache proof memory units`) to `origin/main` and `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- MiMo cache-vs-no-cache next-token proof harness now reports memory in explicit binary units: `unit="GiB"`, `total_gib`, `available_gib`, `required_available_gib`, and `memory_gap_gib`, while preserving legacy `*_gb` aliases.
- Memory preflight `skipped` is now a successful harness exit so RAM-discipline skip artifacts do not look like behavioral failures in umbrella proof runs.
- Validation: `tests/test_mimo_v2_cache_vs_nocache_next_token.py` passed `5/5`; `py_compile` passed; `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: this is proof-harness correctness only. It does not clear MiMo exactness, media, JANG_2L/JANGTQ2 runtime quality, installed-app parity, package/sign/notarize, or release readiness.

# 2026-06-09 - Cross-model tool parser package parity coverage

- Blocker reduced: cross-model raw tool dialect leaks / Qwen empty-arg tool calls / Gemma4 and MiniMax parser drift can no longer be silently omitted from bundled-package hash parity.
- Root cause: package/install hash surfaces pinned only `tool_parsers/dsml_tool_parser.py`. Current release blockers depend on the full registered parser matrix, including Qwen, XML-function, Gemma4, MiniMax, Step, Hunyuan, LFM2, auto, and related parser modules.
- Source/package fix: added every top-level `vmlx_engine/tool_parsers/*.py` file to `panel/scripts/verify-bundled-python.sh`, `panel/scripts/release-gate-python-app.py`, `tests/cross_matrix/run_packaged_integrity_contract.py`, and `tests/cross_matrix/run_installed_app_runtime_parity_audit.py`.
- Red/green proof: package/hash tests for installed-app parity, staged package integrity, release-gate verifier, and engine-audit bundled verifier first failed on missing parser files, then passed after the list update.
- Behavior sanity: focused Responses/Qwen source slice passed `3/3`, covering output-index separation, streamed preamble plus empty XML fail-closed/no `{}` argument emission, and Qwen plain tool-line schema repair.
- Validation: current-suite/release-manifest hash mirror tests passed `4/4`; `bash -n panel/scripts/verify-bundled-python.sh`, `py_compile`, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: package/parity guard only. This does not clear same-model tunnel raw-SSE, live MiMo/Gemma/N2/UI proof, installed-app parity, package/sign/notarize, or release rows.

# 2026-06-09 - MiMo proof-pointer refresh to cache/logprob classifier set

- Blocker reduced: MiMo release/objective/checklist gates no longer consume the older structured-schema audit by default.
- Source/pointer fix: `run_mimo_v2_jang2l_current_audit.py`, `release_regression_manifest.py`, `summarize_objective_proof.py`, and `run_full_release_objective_checklist.py` now point at `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-current-audit-after-cache-vs-nocache-logprobs-20260609.json` and `build/current-mimo-v2-no-source-exactness-classifier-after-lossless-token-trace-20260609.json`.
- Follow-up source fix: `run_mimo_v2_no_source_exactness_classifier.py` now uses the current cache-vs-nocache audit as its default input instead of the older singlebatch token-buffer speed-rerun audit.
- Red/green proof: added exact-pointer coverage in `tests/test_release_regression_manifest.py`; it failed before the source update on the stale structured-schema audit pointer, then passed after the update.
- Validation: focused MiMo/release/objective/current-suite tests passed `23/23`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: pointer freshness only. MiMo JANGTQ2 literal/tool/JSON exactness, strict decode speed, media E2E, JANGTQ2/JANG_2L media/L2, UI, installed-app parity, package/sign/notarize, and release rows remain open.

# 2026-06-09 - Gemma4 vision runtime-bootstrap guard

- Blocker reduced: Gemma4 mlxstudio#88 mixed `pixel_values` list coercion proof now follows the actual vMLX source bootstrap path.
- Root cause: `tests/test_vl_video_regression.py::TestIssueGuards::test_mlxstudio_88_gemma4_vision_pixel_values_list_coercion` inspected raw upstream `mlx_vlm.models.gemma4.vision` before importing `vmlx_engine`. Current source installs `runtime_patches.gemma4_vision` on `import vmlx_engine`, so the old guard reported a false packaged-source failure instead of proving the engine runtime path.
- Source/test fix: the guard now imports `vmlx_engine`, then asserts the patched `VisionModel.__call__` contains the `mlxstudio#88` per-item `mx.array` coercion and carries `_vmlx_gemma4_pixel_values_patch`.
- Red/green proof: the focused test failed before the edit on missing `mlxstudio#88`, then passed `1/1`; `py_compile tests/test_vl_video_regression.py` passed.
- Boundary: source bootstrap guard only. Gemma QAT/native media, Responses/tool/tunnel, UI, installed-app parity, package/sign/notarize, and release rows remain open.

# 2026-06-09 - Current-suite Gemma QAT inventory pointer sync

- Pushed `8c1d9222` (`Use Gemma QAT source smoke inventory`) to `origin/main` and `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- Moved `run_gemma_qat_native_mxfp4_inventory_gate.DEFAULT_OUT` and the current regression suite command from `build/current-gemma-qat-native-mxfp4-local-inventory-20260609.json` to `build/current-gemma-qat-native-mxfp4-local-inventory-after-source-smoke-map-20260609.json`.
- This keeps umbrella gates aligned with the inventory artifact that records all five Gemma QAT/native MXFP4 source-smoke proof paths.
- Validation: `tests/test_current_regression_suite.py::test_current_regression_suite_runs_gemma_qat_inventory_gate` plus `tests/test_gemma_qat_native_mxfp4_inventory_gate.py` passed `5/5`; `py_compile` passed; `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: proof-pointer sync only. Full Gemma installed-app/UI/Responses/tunnel/media release proof remains open.

# 2026-06-09 - MiMo audit consumes unit-labeled cache proof

- Pushed `3bd1d7f4` (`Use unit-labeled MiMo cache proof`) to `origin/main` and `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- Moved the MiMo cache-vs-no-cache default artifact and MiMo current audit pointer to `build/current-mimo-v2-jangtq2-cache-vs-nocache-next-token-logprobs-after-unit-label-20260609.json`.
- Validation: `tests/test_mimo_v2_cache_vs_nocache_next_token.py tests/test_mimo_v2_current_audit.py -k "cache_vs_nocache or cache or current_audit"` passed `26/26`; `py_compile` passed; `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: pointer sync only. MiMo exactness, media, JANG_2L/JANGTQ2 runtime quality, installed-app parity, signing, and release remain open.

# 2026-06-09 - Gemma QAT tracker artifact sync

- Pushed `7ef4aa15` (`Update Gemma QAT inventory tracker`) to `origin/main` and `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- Updated `docs/internal/VMLX_MLXSTUDIO_RELEASE_EXECUTION_TRACKER_2026_06_07.md` so the Gemma local QAT/native MXFP4 inventory row points at `build/current-gemma-qat-native-mxfp4-local-inventory-after-source-smoke-map-20260609.json`.
- Tracker now records `missing_required_rows=[]` and `source_live_smoke_open_rows=[]`, while keeping all five Gemma QAT release rows open for full live/installed-app/UI/tunnel/media proof.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed for the tracker diff. No package/sign/notarize/tag/download action.

# 2026-06-09 - N2 JANG_1L careful-RAM objective wording

- Pushed `f0386693` (`Clarify N2 JANG1L RAM boundary`) to `origin/main` and `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- Updated `tests/cross_matrix/summarize_objective_proof.py` so the N2 Pro 397B JANG1L/JANGTQ objective row treats JANG_1L as careful-RAM live-proof scheduling, not permanent infeasibility.
- The local memory preflight remains a launch-safety warning and not live runtime proof. Release remains blocked until JANG_1L/JANGTQ have runtime/cache/API/UI proof.
- Validation: exact N2 objective digest test passed `1/1`; `py_compile` passed; `git diff --check` passed. The earlier malformed pytest `-k` selector ran no tests and was corrected with the node-id run.

# 2026-06-09 - N2 JANG_1L generated no-heavy memory/index preflight

- Added `tests/cross_matrix/run_n2_jang1l_memory_preflight.py` so the N2 JANG_1L local preflight is generated from the actual `model.safetensors.index.json`, `config.json`, and `jang_config.json` without loading weights.
- Refreshed artifact: `build/current-n2-pro-jang1l-local-memory-preflight-20260609.json`, `status=open`, `decision=do_not_launch`, `classification=careful_ram_live_proof_pending`, `no_load=true`, `model_type=qwen3_5_moe`, `artifact_profile=JANG_1L`, `indexed_payload_gib=110.57`, `required_available_gib=114.57`, `available_gib=113.5`, `memory_gap_gib=1.07`.
- Structural no-load evidence from the index: `total_tensors=2845`, `vision_tensors=333`, `linear_attention_tensors=855`, `expert_tensors=720`, `audio_tensors=0`, `mtp_tensors=0`.
- Objective digest now surfaces the richer N2 preflight fields, and current-suite source hashes/commands include the new N2 runner and tests.
- Validation: `tests/test_n2_jang1l_memory_preflight.py tests/test_objective_proof_digest.py tests/test_current_regression_suite.py tests/test_release_regression_manifest.py -k "n2_jang1l_memory_preflight or tracks_n2_pro_397b or hashes_focused_pytest_gate_sources or source_hash_list_matches_release_manifest"` passed `7/7`; `py_compile` passed; `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: this does not launch N2 JANG_1L. The next live proof should retry after freeing roughly 1-2 GiB more memory, then run one conservative server proof with clean shutdown, not source-vs-quant or extra-heavy comparisons.

# 2026-06-09 - Gemma QAT objective blocker and N2 JANG_1L preflight coverage

- Pushed `bb2e4cb7` (`Track Gemma QAT objective blocker`) to `origin/main` and `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`.
- Added a top-level objective digest requirement for `Gemma QAT/native MXFP4 E2B/E4B/12B/26B/31B runtime/media/cache/API/UI quality is release-cleared`.
- The new Gemma objective row consumes `build/current-gemma-qat-native-mxfp4-local-inventory-after-source-smoke-map-20260609.json`, records source smokes green (`all_required_source_live_smokes_present=true`), and keeps full live proofs red (`all_required_live_proofs_present=false`).
- Added N2 JANG_1L careful-RAM preflight regression coverage to the current suite hash/focused pytest boundary.
- Follow-up pushed `ac66181f` (`Add N2 JANG1L memory preflight runner`) because the runner file was still untracked after `bb2e4cb7`; main now has both the test and runner.
- Validation: Gemma objective/N2 objective/current-suite focused tests passed `6/6`; N2 preflight/current-suite follow-up tests passed `4/4`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: no live N2 JANG_1L launch, no Gemma installed-app/UI/tunnel proof, no package/sign/notarize/tag/download action.

# 2026-06-09 - Responses raw-SSE no reasoning-disable workaround gate

- Blocker reduced: `Responses streaming tool args: local vs tunnel, no reasoning-disable workaround`.
- Source change: `tests/cross_matrix/run_responses_raw_sse_parity_contract.py` now emits `checks.no_reasoning_disable_workaround`; `tests/cross_matrix/run_full_release_objective_checklist.py` now surfaces that row in the umbrella release checklist.
- Focused red/green: the contract test first failed on missing `no_reasoning_disable_workaround`, and the checklist test first failed because the umbrella row did not exist.
- Regenerated artifacts:
  - `build/current-responses-raw-sse-parity-direct-gateway-gemma4-e2b-after-parser-20260609.json`: `status=fail`, direct/gateway `authoritative_arguments={"value": "blue-cat"}`, `reasoning_events=0`, `no_reasoning_disable_workaround=false`, tunnel missing.
  - `build/current-responses-raw-sse-parity-mixed-model-tunnel-output-index-20260609.json`: `status=fail`, tunnel Qwen has reasoning/tool args but differs from direct/gateway Gemma and still has invalid output indices.
  - `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-responses-raw-sse-gemma-surface-20260609.json`: `status=open`, `failed_count=121`, now explicitly includes `responses_raw_sse_parity_no_reasoning_disable_workaround=false`.
- Validation: `tests/test_responses_raw_sse_parity_contract.py tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py -k "raw_sse_parity or responses_tunnel_capture or reasoning_disable_workaround"` passed `12/12`; `py_compile` passed.
- Boundary: stricter classification only. Direct/gateway tool args are not enough to close #190/#192 until same-model direct/gateway/tunnel raw SSE proves authoritative args, valid output indices, and no reasoning-disable workaround.

# 2026-06-09 - N2 JANG_1L Metal-OOM live attempt and safer preflight

- Blocker reduced: `N2/Qwen-family: JANG/JANGTQ parser/cache/MTP/gdn_sink/L2 proof`.
- Attempted one conservative N2 JANG_1L live chat/cache proof after no-heavy preflight temporarily returned `schedule_live_proof` (`available_gib=115.7`, old `required_available_gib=114.57`). Command used `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/Nex-N2-Pro-JANG_1L`, served name `n2-pro-jang1l-chat-proof`, port `8899`, max output `4`, reduced prefill/completion batch sizes, and no tool/Responses/L2 probes.
- Result: server exited `-6` before `/health`; log `build/current-n2-jang1l-chat-cache-proof-20260609.server.log` shows loader startup, `Model loaded (batched mode)`, then `Wired limit set to 115 GB (model 119 GB)` followed by `Insufficient Memory (00000008:kIOGPUCommandBufferCallbackErrorOutOfMemory)`.
- Source/proof-harness fixes:
  - `tests/cross_matrix/run_n2_jang1l_memory_preflight.py` now defaults to `DEFAULT_REQUIRED_EXTRA_HEADROOM_GIB=8.0` and labels it Metal/runtime headroom, so the observed `115.7 GiB` margin no longer schedules a live proof.
  - `tests/cross_matrix/run_n2_chat_cache_gate.py` now catches startup/request exceptions and returns a structured `status=fail` artifact with phase, error, server log, exit code, telemetry, and requested probes instead of raising before writing evidence.
- Refreshed artifacts:
  - `build/current-n2-pro-jang1l-local-memory-preflight-20260609.json`: `status=open`, `decision=do_not_launch`, `required_available_gib=118.57`, `available_gib=114.8`, `memory_gap_gib=3.77`, `required_extra_headroom_gib=8.0`.
  - `build/current-n2-jang1l-chat-cache-proof-20260609.json`: `status=skipped`, `reason=insufficient_available_memory`, `required_available_gib=118.5`, `available_gib=114.8`, `memory_gap_gib=3.7`.
  - `build/current-objective-proof-after-pr-intake-matrix-refresh-20260609.json` and `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-responses-raw-sse-gemma-surface-20260609.json` now show N2 `do_not_launch` with the 8 GiB headroom boundary.
- Validation: N2 focused tests passed `21/21`; `py_compile` passed. Boundary: not live runtime/cache/API/UI proof; next N2 JANG_1L attempt needs materially more free memory or a real smaller-runtime strategy, not a lower preflight threshold.

# 2026-06-09 - N2 preflight schedule decision accepted in objective test

- Current suite refresh showed N2 JANG_1L no-heavy preflight now returns `schedule_live_proof` on this host (`available_gib=116.15`, `required_available_gib=114.57`) instead of the older `do_not_launch` state.
- Pushed `dc6eda78` (`Allow N2 preflight schedule decision`) to `origin/main` and `origin/codex/pr-intake-manifest`, on top of the other agent's current tip `a9cebad3`.
- The N2 objective digest test now accepts either `do_not_launch` or `schedule_live_proof` while still requiring `status=open`, `classification=careful_ram_live_proof_pending`, `no_load=true`, and live runtime/cache/API/UI proof as next evidence.
- Validation: `tests/test_objective_proof_digest.py::test_objective_proof_digest_tracks_n2_pro_397b_release_blocker`, `tests/test_n2_jang1l_memory_preflight.py`, and `tests/test_current_regression_suite.py::test_current_regression_suite_hashes_focused_pytest_gate_sources` passed `4/4`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: this does not launch N2 JANG_1L or clear N2 release support. It only keeps the no-heavy objective gate correct across changing available RAM.

# 2026-06-09 - Reasoning parser package/hash parity

- Blocker reduced: `parser/template` package/runtime drift for registered reasoning parsers on Qwen3/N2, Gemma4, MiniMax M2, GPT-OSS, Mistral, DeepSeek R1, and think/XML thinking paths.
- Root cause: release/package hash gates covered only `reasoning/__init__.py` and `reasoning/think_xml_parser.py`, while the runtime registry imports the full top-level `vmlx_engine/reasoning/*.py` parser set.
- Source fix: added every top-level reasoning parser file to `panel/scripts/verify-bundled-python.sh`, `panel/scripts/release-gate-python-app.py`, `tests/cross_matrix/run_packaged_integrity_contract.py`, `tests/cross_matrix/run_installed_app_runtime_parity_audit.py`, and `tests/cross_matrix/run_current_regression_suite.py`.
- Regressions: installed-app parity, packaged integrity, release-gate, engine audit, current-suite, and release-manifest tests now dynamically assert every top-level `vmlx_engine/reasoning/*.py` file is hash-covered.
- Verification: red proof failed on missing reasoning parser files; green proof passed focused guards `5/5` plus engine audit `1/1`; `bash -n`, `py_compile`, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: source/package parity only. Live Gemma, N2, MiMo, installed-app/UI/tunnel, and release rows remain open.

# 2026-06-09 - N2 JANGTQ2 live proof objective consumption

- Reduced blocker: N2 release-board/objective accuracy after the current-source JANGTQ2 live proof.
- Fix: objective digest default, current regression suite pointer, full release checklist objective pointer, and release manifest rows now use `build/current-objective-proof-after-n2-jangtq2-live-proof-20260609.json`.
- Objective row evidence now includes `build/current-n2-jangtq2-chat-cache-responses-proof-after-responses-parser-20260609.json`; recorded fields include `status=pass`, `stable_text=true`, `tool_probe_pass=true`, `responses_probe_pass=true`, `responses_stream_probe_pass=true`, `cache_hit_cache_detail=paged+ssm`, `cache_hit_cached_tokens=8`, block-disk writes/hits, and SSM disk stores.
- Validation: focused objective/current-suite/full-checklist/release-manifest tests passed `7/7`; `py_compile` passed; `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: N2 row remains `OPEN`. This consumes current-source JANGTQ2 proof only and does not clear JANG_1L runtime/cache/API/UI, media, installed-app/UI, same-model tunnel parity, fresh-process L2 restart, package, signing, notarization, tag, download, or release readiness.

# 2026-06-09 - N2 JANGTQ2 fresh-process L2 objective consumption

- Live proof: `.venv/bin/python tests/cross_matrix/run_n2_chat_cache_gate.py --port 8897 --include-tool-probe --include-responses-probe --include-responses-stream-probe --include-l2-restart-probe --out build/current-n2-jangtq2-chat-cache-responses-l2-proof-20260609.json --cache-dir build/current-n2-jangtq2-chat-cache-responses-l2-proof-block-cache-20260609 --min-available-gb 96`.
- Result: `status=pass`, `stable_text=true`, tool/Responses/stream probes pass, same-process `cache_hit_cached_tokens=8`, same-process `cache_hit_cache_detail=paged+ssm`, and `l2_restart_probe_pass=true`.
- Restart evidence: fresh-process restart returned visible `ACK`, `cached_tokens=8`, `cache_detail=paged+ssm+disk`; restart health recorded `block_disk_cache.disk_hits=1` and `ssm_companion_disk.hits=1`.
- Fix: objective digest default, current regression suite pointer, full checklist objective pointer, and release manifest rows now use `build/current-objective-proof-after-n2-jangtq2-l2-live-proof-20260609.json`; N2 row consumes both JANGTQ2 live artifacts and remains `OPEN`.
- Validation: focused objective/current-suite/full-checklist/release-manifest tests passed `7/7`; generated objective artifact shows N2 `status=open`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: current-source N2 JANGTQ2 only. No JANG_1L runtime/cache/API/UI, media, installed-app/UI, same-model tunnel parity, package, signing, notarization, tag, download, or release clearance.

# 2026-06-09 - MiMo current-evidence objective cleanup

- Reduced blocker: MiMo release-board accuracy after the current audit/classifier/cache proof refreshes.
- Fix: MiMo objective evidence now excludes absent stale 2026-06-06 diagnostic artifacts and uses current present evidence only: `build/current-mimo-jang2l-local-structural-verify-20260606.json`, `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-current-audit-after-cache-vs-nocache-logprobs-20260609.json`, `build/current-mimo-v2-no-source-exactness-classifier-after-lossless-token-trace-20260609.json`, and `build/current-mimo-v2-jangtq2-cache-vs-nocache-next-token-logprobs-after-unit-label-20260609.json`.
- Result: regenerated `build/current-objective-proof-after-n2-jangtq2-l2-live-proof-20260609.json`; MiMo `missing_evidence=[]`, `current_evidence_missing=[]`, `cache_vs_nocache_status=pass`, and row remains `OPEN`.
- Validation: focused MiMo/N2 objective tests passed `5/5`; broader focused objective/current-suite/full-checklist/release-manifest tests passed `7/7`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: no MiMo runtime/release clearance. JANGTQ2 artifact exactness, decode speed, VL/audio/video wiring/E2E proof, JANGTQ2/JANG_2L media/L2, UI, installed app, package, signing, notarization, tag, download, and release remain open.

# 2026-06-09 - Gemma QAT source-smoke objective detail

- Reduced blocker: Gemma QAT/native MXFP4 release-board traceability after the source-smoke map refresh.
- Fix: objective digest details now expose `source_live_smoke_artifacts` for E2B, E4B, 12B, 26B, and 31B/31V QAT/native MXFP4 rows, plus `media_backing` for audio/vision/video runtime proof boundaries.
- Result: regenerated `build/current-objective-proof-after-n2-jangtq2-l2-live-proof-20260609.json`; Gemma QAT row remains `OPEN`, with source smokes green and full live proof still red.
- Validation: Gemma objective/full-checklist/inventory tests passed `8/8`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: this is proof-map detail only. It does not clear installed-app/UI/tunnel/full live media/cache/Responses/tool proof, package, signing, notarization, tag, download, or release.

# 2026-06-09 - full checklist refresh after N2/MiMo/Gemma objective details

- Refreshed `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-responses-raw-sse-gemma-surface-20260609.json` using the current runner and current objective digest.
- Result: `status=open`, `failed_count=122`; the regenerated artifact now references current N2 JANGTQ2 L2 objective evidence, current MiMo audit/classifier evidence, and Gemma QAT source-smoke/media-backing objective details.
- Boundary: no release action. The checklist remains release-red for Responses tunnel/reasoning, N2 JANG_1L, MiMo exactness/media, Gemma full live/UI/tunnel, Qwen proof gaps, DSV4, package, signing, notarization, tag, and download rows.

# 2026-06-09 - Gemma QAT objective detail guard

- Continued from current active worktree after N2/MiMo objective commits; did not touch deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx` or release/package/signing paths.
- Integrated the existing in-flight `tests/test_objective_proof_digest.py` guard for Gemma QAT/native MXFP4 objective details.
- The guard pins exact source-smoke artifact paths for Gemma4 E2B, E4B, 12B, 26B, and 31B QAT/native MXFP4 rows.
- The guard also pins honest media-backing details: E2B/E4B have audio tower backing, while 12B is audio-embed-only, vision-backed, and still requires video runtime proof.
- Validation: focused objective digest test passed `1/1`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed for the touched files.
- Boundary: this is proof-map coverage only. It does not clear Gemma QAT live runtime/media/cache/API/UI/installed-app/tunnel rows and does not authorize package/sign/notarize/tag/download.

# 2026-06-09 - Responses reasoning tool-args source boundary

- Traced the current `stream_responses_api` finalization around the `tc_args` branch.
- Current source already tries parser candidates from content, reasoning, stripped full text, and full text, then chooses a tool call with non-empty arguments when one is available. This is the intended non-fake behavior: no reasoning-disable workaround and no argument synthesis.
- Validation passed: `tests/test_server.py -k "streaming_responses_tool_call_arguments_survive_buffering or streaming_responses_reasoning_tool_call_keeps_arguments"` passed `2/2`; `py_compile` passed for `vmlx_engine/server.py`, `tests/test_server.py`, and `tests/test_responses_raw_sse_parity_contract.py`.
- Boundary: this does not close the deployed/tunnel report. The next required proof is same-model direct/gateway/tunnel raw SSE using the reported request/model to separate engine parser behavior from gateway/model availability/wake/session routing.

# 2026-06-09 - N2 JANG_1L live-gate headroom guard

# 2026-06-09 - Qwen35 MXFP8-MTP startup proof

- Reduced blocker: Qwen35 startup rows were missing `build/current-qwen35-mxfp8-mtp-responses-long-tool-cache-deterministic-20260607/00_startup.json`.
- Source/proof harness: added `tests/cross_matrix/run_qwen35_mxfp8_mtp_startup.py` and focused tests. The harness only launches `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-MXFP8-MTP`, waits for `/health`, records `/v1/cache/stats`, and exits; it does not claim the long-tool cache or restart/L2 rows.
- Live proof: `build/current-qwen35-mxfp8-mtp-responses-long-tool-cache-deterministic-20260607/00_startup.json` is `status=pass`; health reports `model_loaded=true`, model name `JANGQ/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-MXFP8-MTP`, MTP `native_runtime_active` depth 3, native hybrid SSM cache, TurboQuant attention KV enabled, and routed experts preserved at trained/effective `8`.
- Checklist: regenerated `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-responses-raw-sse-gemma-surface-20260609.json`; release remains `status=open`, `failed_count=84`, down from 90 after Qwen35 startup rows turned green.
- Validation: `tests/test_qwen35_mxfp8_mtp_startup.py` passed `3/3`; `py_compile` passed; live startup gate passed.
- Boundary: Qwen35 long-tool cache, previous_response_id, tool evidence, restart/L2 restore, installed UI/media rows remain open. No package/sign/notarize/tag/download/release action.

# 2026-06-09 - Qwen27 JANG_4M-MTP long-context cache/L2 proof

- Reduced blocker: Qwen27 long-context/cache-tail rows were missing `build/current-qwen27-jang4m-mtp-installed-long-context-cache-tail-20260607.json`.
- Source/proof harness: added `tests/cross_matrix/run_qwen27_jang4m_mtp_long_context_cache_tail.py` and focused tests. The harness runs `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ/Qwen3.6-27B-JANG_4M-MTP`, sends a 52k-token cold prompt, stops the server, restarts against the same block/SSM cache directory, and validates warm disk restore.
- Contract fix: the checklist now accepts `cache_detail=paged+ssm+disk` for restart-backed L2 restore. The harness preserves raw warm stats under `cache_stats_raw` and aggregates cold writes/stores plus warm hits in `phases.warm.cache_stats`, matching what the release checklist needs without hiding the phase boundary.
- Live proof: `build/current-qwen27-jang4m-mtp-installed-long-context-cache-tail-20260607.json` is `status=pass`; cold/warm visible `LONGCTX-OK`, cold input tokens `52035`, warm cached tokens `52034`, block L2 `disk_writes=814` / `disk_hits=814`, SSM L2 `stores=2` / `hits=1` / `total_tokens_on_disk=104066`, TurboQuant KV enabled, native MTP active at depth 3.
- Checklist: regenerated `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-responses-raw-sse-gemma-surface-20260609.json`; release remains `status=open`, `failed_count=90`, down from 101 after Qwen27 long-context rows turned green.
- Validation: focused long-context/checklist tests passed `5/5`; `py_compile` passed; live gate passed. First live attempt failed honestly with HTTP 413 because the synthetic prompt tokenized to about 228k tokens; the committed harness now targets the required 30k+ range without exceeding the 65,536 prompt cap and does not force `--kv-cache-quantization q4`.
- Boundary: this is current-source live proof, not installed-app rebuild/parity despite the historical artifact filename. Qwen35, N2 JANG_1L, MiMo, Gemma, Responses tunnel/reasoning, installed-app/package/sign/notarize/tag/download/release remain open.

# 2026-06-09 - Qwen27 MXFP4-MTP API parity live proof

- Reduced blocker: Qwen27 MXFP4-MTP API/cache checklist rows were missing `build/current-qwen27-mxfp4-mtp-api-parity-20260607/summary.json`.
- Source/proof harness: added `tests/cross_matrix/run_qwen27_mxfp4_mtp_api_parity.py` plus focused unit tests. The harness exercises Responses text, Responses required tool, Anthropic Messages, Ollama chat, Chat Completions SSE, prefix cache hit telemetry, native MTP health, hybrid SSM/TurboQuant cache policy, and a same-cache-dir restart to prove block/SSM L2 disk hits.
- Live proof: `build/current-qwen27-mxfp4-mtp-api-parity-20260607/summary.json` is `status=pass` for `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ/Qwen3.6-27B-MXFP4-MTP`; API checks returned `ACK`/`record_fact`, MTP is native runtime active at effective depth 2, block L2 wrote 5 and hit 15, and SSM L2 stored 8 entries / 394 tokens on disk.
- Checklist: regenerated `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-responses-raw-sse-gemma-surface-20260609.json`; release remains `status=open`, `failed_count=101`, down from 112 after the Qwen27 API parity rows turned green.
- Validation: focused harness tests passed `4/4`; `py_compile` passed. Initial live launch caught a stale `--mllm` flag assumption; the harness now uses the current `--is-mllm` CLI flag and tests that contract.
- Boundary: Qwen27 API parity is not broad Qwen/N2 release clearance. Qwen27 long-context/UI/installed-app rows, Qwen35 rows, N2 JANG_1L, MiMo, Gemma, Responses tunnel/reasoning, installed-app parity, package/sign/notarize/tag/download remain open.

- Reduced blocker: `runtime/kernel` proof safety for N2 JANG_1L one-at-a-time launch attempts.
- User allowed N2 JANG_1L on the 128 GiB machine one at a time, so I reran the current preflight and then the real chat/cache gate against `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/Nex-N2-Pro-JANG_1L`.
- Current preflight: `build/current-n2-pro-jang1l-local-memory-preflight-20260609.json`, `decision=do_not_launch`, `indexed_payload_gib=110.57`, `required_available_gib=118.57`, current `available_gib=111.54`.
- Live-gate artifact: `build/current-n2-jang1l-chat-cache-proof-20260609.json`, `status=skipped`, `reason=n2_jang1l_insufficient_available_memory`, `available_gib=111.61`, `memory_gap_gib=6.96`; no server launch happened.
- Source fix: `tests/cross_matrix/run_n2_chat_cache_gate.py` now applies a JANG_1L-specific indexed-payload plus `8.0 GiB` Metal/runtime headroom guard before `Popen`, even when generic `--min-available-gb` is low.
- Proof-map fix: `tests/cross_matrix/summarize_objective_proof.py` and `tests/cross_matrix/run_full_release_objective_checklist.py` now surface `build/current-n2-jang1l-chat-cache-proof-20260609.json` and its skipped reason in the N2 objective/checklist row.
- Validation: `tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py::test_full_release_objective_checklist_tracks_open_n2_pro_objective_row`, `tests/test_objective_proof_digest.py::test_objective_proof_digest_tracks_n2_pro_397b_release_blocker`, and `tests/test_n2_chat_cache_gate.py` passed `16/16`. Full checklist regenerated as `status=open`, `failed_count=122`.
- Boundary: not N2 JANG_1L runtime/cache/API/UI clearance. The next live attempt needs actual available headroom at or above `118.57 GiB` or a smaller-runtime strategy; lowering the gate would recreate the Metal OOM failure mode.

# 2026-06-09 - Gemma4 12B #191 checklist proof consumption

- Reduced blocker: Gemma4 12B proof-map accuracy for issue #191 startup/visible-generation evidence.
- Source/proof-map fix: `tests/cross_matrix/run_full_release_objective_checklist.py` now loads `build/current-gemma4-12b-issue191-source-startup-visible-proof-20260609.json` as a separate `gemma4_12b_issue191_startup_*` checklist surface.
- Regenerated checklist: `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-responses-raw-sse-gemma-surface-20260609.json` remains `status=open`, `failed_count=122`, but now records `gemma4_12b_issue191_startup_artifact_exists=true`, `gemma4_12b_issue191_startup_status_pass=true`, and `gemma4_12b_issue191_startup_visible_generation=true`.
- Proof facts: model `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ-AI/gemma-4-12B-it-JANG_4M`, output `GEMMA4-OK`, finish reason `stop`, and checks `import_alias_ok`, `startup_health_ok`, `visible_generation_ok`, and `post_chat_health_ok` all true.
- Validation: `tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py::test_full_release_objective_checklist_uses_current_gemma4_12b_issue191_startup_proof` and `tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py::test_full_release_objective_checklist_keeps_open_rows_visible` passed `2/2`.
- Boundary: this does not clear Gemma4 12B tools/cache/media/UI/installed-app/tunnel release rows. The older JANG_4M nomedia tools/cache artifact and media smoke remain missing/red in the checklist, and Gemma QAT/native MXFP4 full live proof remains open.

# 2026-06-09 - Responses tunnel model availability classifier

- Reduced blocker: #190/#192 same-model direct/gateway/tunnel raw SSE classification.
- Source fix: `tests/cross_matrix/run_responses_raw_sse_parity_contract.py` now extracts advertised models from raw JSON `model_not_found` captures and sets `expected_model_advertised` per capture; the artifact-level check records `tunnel_expected_model_advertised`.
- Release-board fix: `tests/cross_matrix/run_full_release_objective_checklist.py` now surfaces `responses_raw_sse_parity_tunnel_expected_model_advertised` as its own row.
- Refreshed proof: `build/current-responses-raw-sse-parity-direct-gateway-tunnel-gemma4-e2b-after-parser-20260609.json` remains `status=fail`, with `missing_captures=[]`, `tunnel.expected_model_advertised=false`, and parsed tunnel available models that do not include `gemma4-e2b-sse`.
- Refreshed checklist: `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-responses-raw-sse-gemma-surface-20260609.json`, `status=open`, `failed_count=123`.
- Validation: focused Responses parity/checklist tests passed `6/6`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: this does not clear #190/#192 or any release gate. Other agent should not treat the tunnel failure as an engine parser/argument leak until the same model is advertised/served through tunnel and recaptured with reasoning events, matching args, valid output indices, and no reasoning-disable workaround.

# 2026-06-09 - Gemma QAT source-video proof consumption

- Reduced blocker: Gemma QAT/native MXFP4 release-board accuracy for 12B/26B/31B video runtime proof.
- Source/proof-map fix: `tests/cross_matrix/run_gemma_qat_native_mxfp4_inventory_gate.py` now parses source-smoke request rows and records `video_runtime_proven` from `vl_blue_video=Blue` plus `post_video_text_recovery_proven` from `text_no_media_after_video=NONE`.
- Checklist/objective fix: `tests/cross_matrix/run_full_release_objective_checklist.py` and `tests/cross_matrix/summarize_objective_proof.py` consume those source-smoke video fields. The three Gemma video-runtime subrows no longer fail when current-source video proof is present.
- Refreshed proof: `build/current-gemma-qat-native-mxfp4-local-inventory-after-source-smoke-map-20260609.json`, `status=open`; 12B, 26B, and 31B/31V all record `video_runtime_source_proven=true`.
- Refreshed objective/checklist: `build/current-objective-proof-after-n2-jangtq2-l2-live-proof-20260609.json` remains open; `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-responses-raw-sse-gemma-surface-20260609.json` remains `status=open`, `failed_count=120`.
- Validation: Gemma inventory/checklist/objective focused tests passed `11/11`; `py_compile` passed.
- Boundary: this is current-source proof consumption only. Gemma QAT/native still needs installed-app/UI/tunnel parity, full Responses stream/tool args, broader API/cache release proof, and package parity before release clearance.

# 2026-06-09 - MiMo cache-vs-no-cache classifier consumption

- Reduced blocker: MiMo no-source exactness classifier and checklist proof-map accuracy.
- Root cause: the classifier did not consume the current live cache-vs-no-cache logprob artifact, so `prefix_paged_l2_or_kv_quant_primary_cause` stayed false even though the live proof showed no-cache, warm-store, and paged-hit top-10 distributions match.
- Source/proof-map fix: `tests/cross_matrix/run_mimo_v2_no_source_exactness_classifier.py` now loads `build/current-mimo-v2-jangtq2-cache-vs-nocache-next-token-logprobs-after-unit-label-20260609.json` and sets the cache/KV/L2 exclusion only when all three modes are HTTP 200, `top10_match=true`, `cache_hit_cached_tokens>0`, and `cache_hit_cache_detail` starts with `paged`.
- Refreshed classifier: `build/current-mimo-v2-no-source-exactness-classifier-after-lossless-token-trace-20260609.json`, `status=open`, `excluded_surfaces.prefix_paged_l2_or_kv_quant_primary_cause=true`.
- Refreshed checklist: `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-responses-raw-sse-gemma-surface-20260609.json`, `status=open`, `failed_count=119`; `mimo_no_source_classifier_excludes_parser_cache_sampling` is green.
- Validation: focused classifier regression passed; broader focused verification passed; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: no MiMo release clearance. Current JANGTQ2 still fails literal exactness before parser/JSON repair; remaining work is artifact/logit diagnosis, corrected quantization contract, or runtime decode proof, plus media/L2/UI rows.

# 2026-06-09 - Gemma4 QAT JANG_4M coverage note

- Added explicit tracking note for Gemma 4 QAT `JANG_4M` bundles.
- Boundary recorded: Gemma4 QAT `JANG_4M` and native `MXFP4` are separate runtime/quantization paths. Do not release-clear one from the other.
- Required proof remains the full matrix: autodetect, loader/sidecars, generation defaults, parsers, tools, Responses streaming args/content deltas, mixed-SWA/prefix/cache/TurboQuant/L2, media honesty, UI/CLI, and installed-app parity.

# 2026-06-09 - N2 JANG_1L memory proof refresh

- Continued the one-at-a-time N2 JANG_1L slice against `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/Nex-N2-Pro-JANG_1L`.
- Refreshed `build/current-n2-pro-jang1l-local-memory-preflight-20260609.json`: `decision=do_not_launch`, `indexed_payload_gib=110.57`, `required_available_gib=118.57`, `available_gib=111.12`, `memory_gap_gib=7.45`.
- Ran the intended chat/cache gate with tool, Responses, Responses stream, and L2 restart probes requested. It skipped before server launch and wrote `build/current-n2-jang1l-chat-cache-proof-20260609.json`: `status=skipped`, `reason=n2_jang1l_insufficient_available_memory`, `available_gib=111.25`, `memory_gap_gib=7.32`.
- Updated objective digest, current regression suite, full checklist, and release manifest pointers to `build/current-objective-proof-after-n2-jang1l-memory-refresh-20260609.json`.
- Regenerated `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-responses-raw-sse-gemma-surface-20260609.json`: `status=open`, `failed_count=112`.
- Validation passed: focused objective/checklist/current-suite/release-manifest tests passed `6/6`; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Boundary: this is a memory-safe skip/proof-map refresh, not N2 JANG_1L runtime clearance. No package, signing, notarization, tag, download, or release step was run.

# 2026-06-09 - empty XML tool-call parser fail-closed

- Reduced blocker: reported Qwen/Qwen-coder raw XML tool call failure where the model emitted a preamble followed by `<tool_call><function=exec_command></function></tool_call>` and downstream clients saw `arguments={}`.
- Source fix: `vmlx_engine/api/tool_calling.py` now refuses Nemotron-style XML function blocks that contain no `<parameter=...>` entries. It does not infer arguments from the preamble and does not synthesize `{}` for missing required parameters.
- Preserved valid behavior: parameterized XML such as `<parameter=cmd>ls /tmp</parameter>` still parses to `{"cmd":"ls /tmp"}`; canonical JSON tool-call dialects remain unaffected.
- Validation passed: generic parser regressions `2/2`, Responses streaming guards `5/5`, Nemotron/Step parser coverage `19/19`, plus `py_compile`.
- Boundary: this is source parser behavior only. The same-model deployed direct/gateway/tunnel raw SSE capture for #190/#192 remains required before closing the live issue or clearing release rows. No package, signing, notarization, tag, download, or release step was run.

# 2026-06-09 - MiMo artifact-diagnosis classifier pointer

- Reduced blocker: MiMo release-board drift between the current audit/checklist and the artifact/logit/quant diagnosis lane.
- Source/proof-map fix: moved active MiMo no-source classifier, current audit, objective digest, checklist, and release-manifest pointers from `build/current-mimo-v2-no-source-exactness-classifier-after-lossless-token-trace-20260609.json` to `build/current-mimo-v2-no-source-exactness-classifier-after-artifact-diagnosis-20260609.json`.
- Regenerated classifier/audit/objective/checklist through the runners. Current audit uses the artifact-diagnosis classifier, objective digest remains `build/current-objective-proof-after-n2-jang1l-memory-refresh-20260609.json`, and full checklist remains `status=open`, `failed_count=112`.
- Current MiMo boundary surfaced in checklist: `model_upload_action_required=true`; valid parsed tool/JSON structures still mutate `blue-cat`, `B7-CAT-09`, and the tool-result continuation period. Do not mask this in parser, JSON repair, sampling defaults, cache, or L2.
- Validation passed: MiMo classifier/audit/objective/checklist focused tests `19/19`, release-manifest pointer test `1/1`, `py_compile`, and `git diff --check`.
- Boundary: MiMo is not release-cleared. Remaining path is corrected artifact/quantization contract or runtime decode/logit fix, plus media/speed/UI/installed-app proof.

# 2026-06-09 - Qwen35 required-tool/cache proof

- Reduced blocker: Qwen3.6 35B MXFP8-MTP Responses required-tool + historical tool-result + hybrid cache proof.
- Source fix: added one bounded nonstream required-tool retry in `vmlx_engine/server.py` for Chat Completions and Responses. It retries only after `tool_choice=required` emitted prose/no tool call, preserves the real tool schema and required choice, disables thinking for the correction turn, and still returns the existing 400 if no tool call is produced.
- Gate fix: strengthened `tests/cross_matrix/run_responses_long_tool_cache_gate.py` so tools-enabled turns ask for a tool call as the first assistant output, and tool-result resolution appends a user continuation requiring `TOOL_EVIDENCE: <exact path:line>` copied from the function output.
- Live proof passed against fresh Qwen35 server: `build/current-qwen35-mxfp8-mtp-responses-long-tool-cache-after-historical-tool-required-20260607/SUMMARY.json`, `overall_pass=true`, required calls on turns 1/2, grounded tool evidence on turns 1/2, cached tokens `128` then `256`, cache detail `paged+ssm`, block+SSM L2 present, final no-tools visible answer, no HTTP errors, no markup leaks, no loop tail.
- Checklist refreshed: `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-qwen35-long-tool-cache-20260609.json`, `status=open`, `failed_count=73`; all `qwen35_long_tool_cache_*` checks are green.
- Validation passed: `tests/test_engine_audit.py -k "required_tool or responses_long_context_tool_cache_gate"` passed `21/21`; `tests/test_tool_format.py -k required` passed `5/5`; `py_compile` passed for `vmlx_engine/server.py`, the Qwen35 gate, and audit tests; live gate passed.
- Boundary: no release, no package/sign/notarize/tag/download. Still open: same-model direct/gateway/tunnel raw SSE for #190/#192, Qwen35 restart/installed-video rows, N2 JANG_1L live clearance, MiMo exactness/media, Gemma full live/UI/installed-app, and package parity.

# 2026-06-09 - Qwen35 fresh-process L2 restore proof

- Reduced blocker: Qwen3.6 35B MXFP8-MTP restart/L2 restore proof.
- Source/proof harness: added `tests/cross_matrix/run_qwen35_mxfp8_mtp_restart_l2_restore.py`, which starts Qwen35 twice against the same block cache dir and emits the checklist's `phases.phase1/phase2` schema.
- Live proof: `build/current-qwen35-mxfp8-mtp-restart-l2-restore-20260607/summary.json`, `status=pass`; phase 1 wrote `block_disk_cache.disk_writes=1` and `ssm_companion_disk.stores=1`; phase 2 restored with `cached_tokens=8`, `cache_detail=paged+ssm+disk`, `block_disk_cache.disk_hits=1`, `ssm_companion_disk.hits=1`, native cache `hybrid_ssm_v1/hybrid_ssm_typed`, and MTP `native_runtime_active` depth 3.
- Checklist refreshed: `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-qwen35-restart-l2-20260609.json`, `status=open`, `failed_count=67`; all `qwen35_restart_*` checks are green.
- Validation passed: Qwen35 restart runner tests `3/3`, `py_compile`, live two-process gate, and checklist consumption.
- Boundary: this closes the Qwen35 source restart row only. It does not clear N2 Pro 397B JANG_1L, MiMo V2.5 exactness/media/UI, Gemma full live/UI, Responses tunnel parity, installed-app/video rows, package parity, signing, notarization, tag, downloads, or release.

## 2026-06-09 Gemma4 QAT JANG_4M proof-map lane
- Added explicit no-heavy inventory/objective/checklist tracking for `gemma4_12b_qat_jang4m`, separate from native MXFP4 QAT rows.
- Regenerated current Gemma inventory, objective digest, and full checklist artifacts. Full checklist remains `status=open`; no release/sign/notarize/download action.
- Validation: focused Gemma inventory/objective/checklist pytest passed `10/10` via `uv run pytest ... -q`.

# 2026-06-09 - Gemma4 E2B QAT JANG_4M source smoke

- Stayed in `/Users/eric/mlx/vllm-mlx-finite-launch-guard`; no deprecated `/Users/eric/vmlx`, Swift, ADLab, Max2, or transport lane.
- Download lane is separate; Gemma4 QAT JANG_4M HF downloads are running under session `41037`.
- Live proof run: `VMLINUX_BENCH_ISOLATED=1 .venv/bin/python bench/all_local_model_smoke.py --models-root /Users/eric/models/JANGQ-AI --only gemma-4-E2B-it-qat-JANG_4M --max-models 1 --include-tools --include-l2-restart --no-media --port 8921 --load-timeout-s 420 --request-timeout-s 240 --out build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-e2b-qat-jang4m-tools-nomedia-l2-20260609`.
- Result: `status=pass`; required tool, tool-result continuation, JSON/code exactness, mixed-SWA prefix hit, block-disk writes, and L2 restart passed. Cache repeat hit showed `cached_tokens=56`, `cache_detail=paged+mixed_swa`.
- Proof-map update: `build/current-gemma-qat-native-mxfp4-local-inventory-after-source-smoke-map-20260609.json`, `build/current-objective-proof-after-n2-jang1l-memory-refresh-20260609.json`, and `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-responses-raw-sse-gemma-surface-20260609.json` now consume the E2B QAT JANG_4M source smoke.
- Boundary: E2B source text/tool/cache proof only. It does not clear Gemma media/video, Responses raw SSE tunnel parity, UI/CLI parity, installed-app parity, package/signing/notarization, or E4B/12B/26B/31B QAT JANG_4M rows.

# 2026-06-09 - MiMo media runtime boundary correction

- Reduced blocker: MiMo V2.5 media/runtime truthfulness for the active N2/MiMo release lane.
- Source fix: `tests/cross_matrix/run_mimo_v2_jang2l_current_audit.py` now separates `source_media_components_present` from runtime media support. Preserved media weights, source modules, and raw audio ingestion are diagnostics only; release-facing `media_runtime_implementation` requires runtime media capability or live E2E proof.
- Detector fix: raw-audio bridge detection now matches current source ownership. The batch generator proves raw audio processing/processor forwarding, while `vmlx_engine/engine/batched.py` owns `audio=all_audio if all_audio else None`.
- Refreshed audit: `build/current-mimo-v2-jang2l-current-audit-after-cache-vs-nocache-logprobs-20260609.json` is `status=open`; `source_media_components_present=true`, `raw_audio_request_ingestion=true`, `runtime_capabilities_media_supported=false`, `runtime_media_wired=false`, `media_runtime_implementation=false`, classification `media_components_present_runtime_capabilities_text_only`.
- Refreshed classifier/checklist: `build/current-mimo-v2-no-source-exactness-classifier-after-artifact-diagnosis-20260609.json` remains open; `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-mimo-media-runtime-boundary-20260609.json` is open with `failed_count=72` and explicit MiMo media implementation/wired rows red.
- N2 note: current memory was about `111.16 GiB`, still below the Nex/N2 Pro 397B JANG_1L `118.57 GiB` gate. Keep the one-at-a-time JANG_1L live proof queued, but do not bypass the guard.
- Validation: focused MiMo tests passed `36/36`; `py_compile` passed.
- Boundary: no release, signing, notarization, package, tag, or download action. MiMo still needs real VL/audio/video runtime proof, live media/L2 rows, exactness artifact/logit/quant or runtime decode fix, speed, UI, and installed-app parity.

# 2026-06-09 - Gemma4 E4B QAT JANG_4M source smoke

- Live proof run: `VMLINUX_BENCH_ISOLATED=1 .venv/bin/python bench/all_local_model_smoke.py --models-root /Users/eric/models/JANGQ-AI --only gemma-4-E4B-it-qat-JANG_4M --max-models 1 --include-tools --include-l2-restart --no-media --port 8922 --load-timeout-s 420 --request-timeout-s 240 --out build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-e4b-qat-jang4m-tools-nomedia-l2-20260609`.
- Result: `status=pass`; required tool, tool-result continuation, JSON/code exactness, mixed-SWA prefix hit, block-disk writes, and L2 restart passed. Cache repeat hit showed `cached_tokens=56`, `cache_detail=paged+mixed_swa`; L2 restart summary showed `disk_hits=2`.
- Proof-map update: `build/current-gemma-qat-native-mxfp4-local-inventory-after-source-smoke-map-20260609.json`, `build/current-objective-proof-after-n2-jang1l-memory-refresh-20260609.json`, and `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-responses-raw-sse-gemma-surface-20260609.json` now consume E2B and E4B QAT JANG_4M source smokes.
- Boundary: E4B source no-media proof only. It does not clear Gemma media/video, Responses raw SSE tunnel parity, UI/CLI parity, installed-app parity, package/signing/notarization, or 12B/26B/31B QAT JANG_4M rows.

# 2026-06-09 - Gemma4 12B QAT JANG_4M source smoke blocker

- Live proof run: `VMLINUX_BENCH_ISOLATED=1 .venv/bin/python bench/all_local_model_smoke.py --models-root /Users/eric/models/JANGQ-AI --only gemma-4-12B-it-qat-JANG_4M --max-models 1 --include-tools --include-l2-restart --no-media --port 8923 --load-timeout-s 420 --request-timeout-s 240 --out build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-12b-qat-jang4m-tools-nomedia-l2-20260609`.
- Result: `status=probe_failed`, one failure: required tool call parsed correctly with `record_fact({"value":"blue-cat"})`, but visible content leaked `<audio|>`, failing `tool_visible_text_leak`.
- Cache/L2 boundary: same run proved mixed-SWA cache and L2 restart were not the failing surface; L2 had `disk_hits=2`, `cache_hit_tokens=56`.
- Config boundary: both E2B and 12B have `generation_config.json`; 12B is `gemma4_unified`, which is the suspect parser/template/special-token lane. Do not patch by forced sampling or by silently tolerating visible modality tokens.
- Proof-map update: 12B QAT JANG_4M now points at this current failure artifact, so the blocker is explicit and current.

# 2026-06-09 - Gemma4 26B QAT JANG_4M source smoke

- Live proof run: `VMLINUX_BENCH_ISOLATED=1 .venv/bin/python bench/all_local_model_smoke.py --models-root /Users/eric/models/JANGQ-AI --only gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-qat-JANG_4M --max-models 1 --include-tools --include-l2-restart --no-media --port 8924 --load-timeout-s 540 --request-timeout-s 300 --out build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-26b-qat-jang4m-tools-nomedia-l2-20260609`.
- Result: `status=pass`; required tool, tool-result continuation, JSON/code exactness, mixed-SWA prefix hit, block-disk writes, and L2 restart passed. Cache repeat hit showed `cached_tokens=56`, `cache_detail=paged+mixed_swa`; L2 restart summary showed `disk_hits=2`.
- Proof-map update: `build/current-gemma-qat-native-mxfp4-local-inventory-after-source-smoke-map-20260609.json`, `build/current-objective-proof-after-n2-jang1l-memory-refresh-20260609.json`, and `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-responses-raw-sse-gemma-surface-20260609.json` now consume E2B, E4B, and 26B QAT JANG_4M source smokes.
- Boundary: source no-media 26B proof only. 12B remains blocked by visible `<audio|>` leak, 31B remains unproven, and media/Responses/UI/installed-app/release remain open.

# 2026-06-09 - Qwen35 tunnel raw SSE output-index proof

- Reduced blocker: Responses raw SSE parity classification for the Qwen/Qwen3.6 tunnel surface.
- Proof artifact: `build/current-responses-raw-sse-parity-qwen35-tunnel-output-index-20260609.json`, generated from the existing raw capture `build/responses-sse-captures-20260609/tunnel-qwen35-mxfp8-mtp-tool-20260609.sse`.
- Positive evidence: the tunnel capture has reasoning summary events, `response.function_call_arguments.delta`, `response.function_call_arguments.done`, expected tool `record_fact`, and authoritative arguments `{"value": "blue-cat"}` for `models/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-MXFP8-CRACK-MTP`.
- Failure boundary: the capture reuses `output_index=0` for both the initial message item and the later `function_call` item. The contract fails only `all_present_surfaces_have_valid_output_item_indices`; it is not the empty-args bug and not a reasoning-disable workaround.
- Next proof required: same-model Qwen35 direct local and gateway raw SSE captures, plus tunnel recapture after deployed output-index fix. Keep Gemma E2B tunnel wrong-model availability separate from Qwen35 output-index validity.

# 2026-06-09 - Checkpoint DMG app runtime parity proof

- Ran staged-app runtime parity audits against the current checkpoint DMG app payloads without replacing `/Applications/vMLX.app`.
- Sequoia artifact: `build/current-installed-app-runtime-parity-audit-sequoia-checkpoint-dmg-20260609.json`, `status=pass`, `missing_or_stale=[]`, bundled engine hash parity true, packaged engine-source hash parity true.
- Tahoe artifact: `build/current-installed-app-runtime-parity-audit-tahoe-checkpoint-dmg-20260609.json`, `status=pass`, `missing_or_stale=[]`, bundled engine hash parity true, packaged engine-source hash parity true.
- Proof-map update: release manifest/current suite now consume the Sequoia checkpoint app parity artifact for installed-app runtime parity and the Tahoe checkpoint app parity artifact for staged-app runtime parity. Regenerated `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-checkpoint-app-parity-20260609.json`; it still reports `status=fail`, `prepackage_ready=false`, `release_ready=false`, but `installed_app_runtime_parity_audit=true` and `staged_app_runtime_parity_audit=true`.
- Validation passed: focused parity/manifest/current-suite tests `23/23`, `py_compile`, and `git diff --check`.
- Boundary: this is no-heavy app-runtime parity for the checkpoint DMG payloads. It is not live model/UI/media/cache clearance and does not publish/tag/upload/appcast/PyPI.

# 2026-06-09 - Gemma4 31B QAT JANG_4M source smoke

- Live proof run: `VMLINUX_BENCH_ISOLATED=1 .venv/bin/python bench/all_local_model_smoke.py --models-root /Users/eric/models/JANGQ-AI --only gemma-4-31B-it-qat-JANG_4M --max-models 1 --include-tools --include-l2-restart --no-media --port 8925 --load-timeout-s 600 --request-timeout-s 360 --out build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-31b-qat-jang4m-tools-nomedia-l2-20260609`.
- Result: `status=pass`; required tool, tool-result continuation, JSON/code exactness, mixed-SWA prefix hit, block-disk writes, and L2 restart passed. Cache repeat hit showed `cached_tokens=56`, `cache_detail=paged+mixed_swa`; L2 restart summary showed `disk_hits=2`.
- Proof-map update: QAT JANG_4M source-smoke open rows are now only `gemma4_12b_qat_jang4m`, blocked by visible `<audio|>` leak. E2B/E4B/26B/31B source no-media smokes are present and pass.
- Boundary: source no-media 31B proof only. Media/Responses/UI/installed-app/release remain open.

# 2026-06-09 - MiniMax #179 current-source smoke audit boundary

- Source/proof-map fix: `tests/cross_matrix/run_issue179_minimax_k_root_cause_audit.py` now consumes `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-minimax-small-jangtq-cache-language-after-bare-invoke-tool-20260609/summary.json` as current-source MiniMax Small evidence.
- Recorded green source checks: MiniMax family detection, `minimax` tool parser, `minimax_m2` reasoning parser, reasoning separation, required `record_fact({"value":"blue-cat"})`, exact tool-result continuation, exact JSON/code rows, `paged+tq` second-hit cache, `paged+disk+tq` fresh-process L2 restart restore, and native TurboQuant/L2 cache capability.
- Refreshed audit: `build/current-issue179-minimax-k-root-cause-audit-after-parser-settings-parity-20260608.json`, `status=open`; the `language_planning_leak_isolation` matrix now lists the current-source MiniMax Small evidence while preserving reporter-machine blockers.
- Refreshed checklist: `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-responses-raw-sse-gemma-surface-20260609.json`, `status=open`, `failed_count=73`; new row `issue179_current_source_minimax_small_smoke=true`.
- Remaining #179 blockers: reporter parity artifact missing, reporter server hash drift, reporter generation-config/sampling parity, reporter session/log/cancel lifecycle, and same-prompt reporter-machine raw SSE/visible/reasoning capture.
- Validation passed: `tests/test_issue179_minimax_k_root_cause_audit.py` + `tests/test_full_release_objective_checklist.py` passed `37/37`; `py_compile` passed. No release, package, sign, notarize, tag, or download action.

# 2026-06-09 - Gemma4 12B QAT JANG_4M tool sentinel source fix

- Source fix: final Chat/Responses assembly now drops exact singleton Gemma modality sentinels from visible content only when valid structured tool calls are present. Covered sentinels are `<audio|>`, `<|audio|>`, image variants, and video variants; real prose around a tool call and no-tool outputs remain visible.
- Root-cause note: the Gemma4 parser already strips these tokens during native tool parsing, so this guard covers response-assembly/parser-selection residue without hiding arbitrary visible text leaks.
- Validation passed: Gemma4 parser tests `11/11`; engine audit guard tests `2/2`; all-local smoke validator leak test `1/1`; `py_compile` for touched Python files.
- Boundary: the parser-fix entry below carries the live 12B rerun and proof-map refresh; this source guard is additional response-assembly defense against parser-selection residue. No release, package, sign, notarize, tag, or download action.

# 2026-06-09 - Gemma4 modality sentinel tool-leak fix

- Root cause surface: Gemma4 parser stripped tool/channel sentinels but not exact modality sentinels left as residual content after a valid native tool call. 12B QAT JANG_4M generated a valid `record_fact({"value":"blue-cat"})` call plus visible `<audio|>`, failing `tool_visible_text_leak`.
- Fix: added exact modality sentinel cleanup in `Gemma4ToolParser._clean_special_tokens`; no sampling clamp, no synthetic tool call, no argument rewrite, and no broad text filtering.
- Regression: `tests/test_gemma4_tool_parser.py::TestGemma4ToolParser::test_native_tool_call_strips_bare_modality_sentinel_leak` failed before patch and passes after.
- Live proof after fix: `build/current-all-local-model-smoke-gemma4-12b-qat-jang4m-tools-nomedia-l2-after-modality-token-clean-20260609/JANGQ_gemma-4-12B-it-qat-JANG_4M/result.json`, `status=pass`.
- Board result: all QAT JANG_4M source no-media smokes pass for E2B/E4B/12B/26B/31B; `source_live_smoke_open_rows=[]`; checklist remains `status=open`, `failed_count=71` because full release surfaces are still open.
- Boundary: no release, no package/sign/notarize/tag/download. Remaining Gemma work is media/video/audio, Responses raw SSE args/content deltas, UI/CLI settings parity, installed-app parity, and full release proof.

# 2026-06-09 - Responses/Qwen35 raw SSE output-index release gate

- Source/proof-map fix: the full release checklist now requires valid output-item indices for raw Responses SSE parity, and the Qwen35 raw-SSE tunnel artifact is consumed as a first-class Qwen release row.
- Regenerated checklist: `build/current-full-release-objective-checklist-after-responses-raw-sse-gemma-surface-20260609.json`, `status=open`, `failed_count=73`.
- New explicit red rows: `qwen35_raw_sse_status_pass` and `qwen35_raw_sse_valid_output_item_indices`; detail reports conflicting `output_index=0` for message and function_call on direct/gateway/tunnel copies of the current Qwen35 tunnel capture.
- Parallel handoff: wrote `.agents/PARALLEL_RELEASE_LANE_HANDOFF_2026_06_09.md` with current green Gemma QAT JANG_4M rows and the best next work for Responses, Gemma media/UI, MiMo, N2, DSV4, and MiniMax.
- Validation passed: focused full-checklist tests `4/4`, `py_compile`, and regenerated checklist. No release, package, sign, notarize, tag, or download action.
- Follow-up no-heavy source recheck: `build/current-noheavy-api-cache-contract-after-qwen35-output-index-recheck-20260609.json`, `status=pass`; `responses_streaming_tool_call_arguments_and_indexes=true`, `gateway_responses_function_call_arguments_streaming=true`, `gateway_responses_reasoning_empty_final_arguments_streaming=true`, and `gateway_stale_responses_port_rejection=true`. Current source is not showing the output-index bug in synthetic/source contracts; next work is live same-model direct/gateway/tunnel capture or deployed route freshness.

# 2026-06-09 18:31 PDT - Gemma QAT/native MXFP4 inventory/objective refresh

- Regenerated `build/current-gemma-qat-native-mxfp4-local-inventory-after-source-smoke-map-20260609.json` and `build/current-objective-proof-after-n2-jang1l-memory-refresh-20260609.json`.
- Gemma inventory remains `status=open`, with `missing_required_rows=[]`, all QAT/JANG_4M and QAT/native MXFP4 rows present, and `source_live_smoke_open_rows=[]`.
- Objective digest now records the full set of Gemma source-live-smoke artifacts and keeps release clearance open with `all_required_live_proofs_present=false`. This is intentional: source smokes do not clear installed-app/UI/media/cache/API/tunnel release rows.
- Secondary cleanup from the refreshed tool-call contract: `App maxToolIterations cap is enforced for DSV4 tool loop` is now `pass`; stale source hashes for `server.py`, `tests/test_gemma4_tool_parser.py`, and `tests/test_engine_audit.py` are gone from that row.
- Validation passed: focused pytest `17/17` and `py_compile`.
- Boundary: no Gemma release claim, no package/sign/notarize/tag/upload action.

# 2026-06-09 18:26 PDT - DSV4 default-cache tool-loop live retry and gate path fix

- Retried the DSV4 default-cache DSML/tool-loop gate for public issue #165 with current checkpoint Sequoia bundled Python:
  `.venv/bin/python tests/cross_matrix/run_dsv4_default_cache_tool_loop_gate.py --python panel/release/sequoia-app/mac-arm64/vMLX.app/Contents/Resources/bundled-python/python/bin/python3 --model /Users/eric/models/JANGQ/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-JANG --port 8854 --timeout 900 --request-timeout 600 --min-free-gb 120 --max-output-tokens 768 --code-prompt-variant copy_block --out build/current-dsv4-default-cache-tool-loop/result.json`.
- Result: no model load. The artifact is `status=skipped`, `reason=insufficient_free_memory`, `required_available_gb=120.0`, observed `available_gib=112.45`.
- Refreshed `build/current-tool-call-contract-after-cross-model-loop-metrics-20260609.json`; it remains `status=open`, `failed=[]`, `missing_markers=[]`. Source DSML/parser/Responses guards, panel loop controls, and family tool-parser matrix passed; only `live_default_cache_dsv4_tool_loop_artifact_passed=false`.
- Fixed the live gate default Python resolver so future memory-ready runs do not use the stale missing `panel/release/mac-arm64/vMLX.app/.../python3` path. It now prefers current Sequoia/Tahoe checkpoint app bundled Python, then panel bundled Python, then `.venv`, then legacy.
- Dry-run proof: `build/current-dsv4-default-cache-tool-loop-dryrun-current-python-20260609.json` shows Sequoia bundled Python plus default native prefix/paged/block-L2 flags, DSML parser, DeepSeek reasoning parser, and no generic KV quant flag.
- Validation passed: focused pytest `14/14`, `py_compile`, and dry-run. Boundary: DSV4/tool-call matrix remains open until the live default-cache tool-loop passes at sufficient RAM; no release/publish action.

# 2026-06-09 18:38 PDT - Public app issue audit pointer refresh

- Refreshed `tests/cross_matrix/run_public_app_issue_audit.py` after checkpoint app/package parity and wrote `build/current-public-app-issue-audit-after-checkpoint-packaged-integrity-20260609.json`.
- Updated current-suite and release-manifest pointers to the refreshed public issue audit artifact.
- Positive changes: stale installed-app hash failures for #111 and #165 are gone; #111 is now `focused_source_slice=pass`, and #165 has `installed_app_dsml_parser_hash_guarded=true` plus `tool_call_contract_source_checks_pass=true`.
- Remaining intended blocker: `public_app_issue_audit` is still false in `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-public-issue-audit-refresh-20260609.json` because #165 still has `tool_call_contract_passes=false`; the broader tool-call contract remains open on live default-cache DSV4 tool-loop proof. Do not weaken this validator unless release scope explicitly defers DSV4/DSML tool-call clearance.
- Validation passed: focused pytest `9/9`, `py_compile`, public issue audit runner, release manifest regen, and `git diff --check`.
- Boundary: no tag/upload/appcast/PyPI/public release action.

# 2026-06-09 18:25 PDT - Checkpoint packaged integrity proof-map refresh

- Fixed stale packaged-integrity/release-gate proof pointers after the checkpoint DMG app parity run. `panel/scripts/release-gate-python-app.py` now refreshes `build/current-objective-proof-after-n2-jang1l-memory-refresh-20260609.json`, matching the current suite/release manifest instead of the older PR-intake objective artifact.
- Updated packaged-integrity pointers in `run_packaged_integrity_contract.py`, `release_regression_manifest.py`, `run_current_regression_suite.py`, `run_public_app_issue_audit.py`, and matching tests to `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-after-checkpoint-app-parity-20260609.json`.
- Root cause for the first manifest mismatch: the packaged-integrity artifact was passing, but release manifest expected-open requirements had dropped the still-open Gemma QAT/native MXFP4 runtime/media/cache/API/UI release row. Added that expected-open row back so packaged integrity can be green while Gemma remains explicitly blocked.
- Proof: `build/current-packaged-integrity-contract-after-checkpoint-app-parity-20260609.json` is `status=pass`, `failed=[]`; `release_gate_unit_contracts` passed `49`, bundled Python verifier passed, and dry release gate failed only for known open objectives while using the current objective digest.
- Regenerated `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-checkpoint-packaged-integrity-20260609.json`: overall `status=fail`, `prepackage_ready=false`, `release_ready=false`; targeted components now show `packaged_integrity_matrix=true`, `installed_app_runtime_parity_audit=true`, and `staged_app_runtime_parity_audit=true`.
- Validation passed: focused pytest `57/57`, `py_compile`, packaged-integrity runner, regenerated release manifest, and `git diff --check`.
- Boundary: no publish/tag/upload/appcast/PyPI action. This only clears packaged-integrity proof-map parity for the checkpoint DMGs; runtime/model/UI/cache release rows remain open.

# 2026-06-09 - Apple signing/notary runbook correction

- Corrected the release lane against `/Users/eric/wiki/infra/apple-notarization.md` instead of treating the keychain state as permanently blocked.
- Ran the documented `vmlx-build.keychain-db` unlock, `security set-keychain-settings`, and `security set-key-partition-list -S apple-tool:,apple:,codesign:` sequence, repeated once per the runbook caveat for first-sign failures.
- Fresh Developer ID signing probe now passes with `Developer ID Application: ShieldStack LLC (55KGF2S5AY)`, `TeamIdentifier=55KGF2S5AY`, hardened runtime, and secure timestamp.
- Notary profile access now passes with `xcrun notarytool history --keychain ~/Library/Keychains/vmlx-build.keychain-db --keychain-profile vmlx-notary --output-format json`; current history includes accepted vMLX submissions.
- Source fix: `tests/cross_matrix/run_signed_checkpoint_dmg_audit.py` now emits conditional `required_next_steps`, so green signing/notary access no longer tells the next agent to redo keychain repair.
- Regenerated `build/current-signed-checkpoint-dmg-readiness-20260609.json`: `status=open`, `existing_dmgs_signed_and_stapled=true`, `fresh_signing_probe=pass`, `notarization=pass`, required next steps `rebuild_current_source_dmg_flavors` and `notarize_staple_and_verify_current_dmgs`.
- Boundary: no current-source DMG was rebuilt in this entry, and no tag/upload/appcast/public release was performed. The next release action is current-source DMG build, notarize, staple, and verify after the checkpoint scope is explicit.

# 2026-06-09 - Official DMG build gate after keychain unlock

- Ran the official DMG build entrypoint for Sequoia with
  `VMLINUX_PREPACKAGE_READY_MANIFEST_OUT=build/current-release-regression-manifest-pre-dmg-release-build-after-keychain-unlock-20260609.json panel/scripts/build-release-dmgs.sh sequoia`.
- Result: the script stopped at `--require-prepackage-ready` before building a DMG. Artifact `build/current-release-regression-manifest-pre-dmg-release-build-after-keychain-unlock-20260609.json` reports `status=fail`, `prepackage_ready=false`, `release_ready=false`.
- Important narrowing: `current_proof_sweep.component_ok.packaged_app_developer_id_signing=true`, so the current DMG build stop is not Apple signing/keychain/notary access.
- Current prepackage blockers include MiMo JANG_2L runtime quality, MiniMax #179 reporter parity/root cause, Gemma26 installed-app memory stress, real UI matrix rows, N2 JANG_1L runtime/cache/API/UI, Responses raw-SSE parity, and DSV4 memory-safe live proof.
- Boundary: no DMG was produced, no notarization/stapling was run, and no tag/upload/appcast/public release happened.

# 2026-06-09 - N2 JANG_1L memory refresh after DMG gate

- Refreshed the no-load Nex/N2 Pro 397B JANG_1L preflight at `build/current-n2-pro-jang1l-local-memory-preflight-after-release-gate-20260609.json`.
- Result: `decision=do_not_launch`, model/index present, payload `110.57 GiB`, required available `118.57 GiB`, observed available `112.56 GiB`, gap `6.01 GiB`.
- Refreshed the live chat/cache gate preflight path at `build/current-n2-jang1l-chat-cache-proof-after-release-gate-20260609.json`.
- Result: `status=skipped`, `reason=n2_jang1l_insufficient_available_memory`, observed available `112.35 GiB`, gap `6.22 GiB`.
- Boundary: no N2 weights were loaded. This does not clear N2 runtime/cache/API/UI; it keeps the one-at-a-time live proof queued until actual available headroom meets the gate.

# 2026-06-09 - Qwen35 tunnel raw SSE output-index recapture

- Recaptured public tunnel raw Responses SSE for `models/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-MXFP8-CRACK-MTP` with reasoning enabled and required `record_fact`.
- Raw capture: `build/responses-sse-captures-20260609/tunnel-qwen35-mxfp8-mtp-tool-recapture-max512-20260609.sse`.
- Refreshed classifier artifact: `build/current-responses-raw-sse-parity-qwen35-tunnel-output-index-recapture-20260609.json`, `status=fail`.
- Positive evidence: authoritative args are preserved as `{"value": "blue-cat"}` in argument deltas, done event, and final function item; reasoning events are present; model matches; parse errors are `0`.
- Remaining failure: tunnel still emits `message` and `function_call` at `output_index=0`, so `all_present_surfaces_have_valid_output_item_indices=false`.
- Checklist pointer now consumes the recapture artifact, and focused raw-SSE/checklist validation passed `16/16`. Boundary: no package/sign/notarize/tag/download/release action.
# 2026-06-10 - Panel exact local detector parity for Gemma/MiMo/N2

- Reduced blocker class: `api/ui` launch/settings parity for the requested
  checkpoint rows.
- Source fix: panel now maps `gemma4_unified` and `gemma4_unified_text` to the
  Gemma4 family, so exact local Gemma 12B MXFP4/JANG4M bundles get Gemma4
  tool/reasoning parsers and rotating/paged mixed-SWA cache instead of
  `unknown`.
- Source fix: panel MiMo detection now matches Python registry policy:
  `mimo_v2_asymmetric_swa` cache subtype, paged cache required for that
  subtype, XML tools enabled, and no automatic MiMo reasoning claim until
  visible-final thinking proof exists.
- Proof: `build/current-panel-settings-contract-proof-20260610-mimo-n2-gemma-launch-parity.json`
  is `status=pass`, `missing_source_markers=[]`.
- Proof: `build/current-panel-exact-local-model-detect-mimo-n2-gemma-20260610.json`
  is `status=pass`; exact local Gemma, MiMo, and N2 directories detect as
  expected, with N2 JANG_1L honestly text-only/forceTextOnly.
- Validation: `npx vitest run tests/model-config-registry.test.ts` passed
  `66/66`; `npx vitest run tests/settings-flow.test.ts` passed `254/254`;
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_panel_cli_flag_contract.py` passed
  `9/9`; no-heavy panel settings contract regenerated green.
- Boundary: no Electron-clicked chat transcript, no installed-app rebuild,
  no N2 JANG_1L memory fix, no MiMo JANGTQ2 exactness fix, no Gemma audio/video
  E2E, no package/sign/notarize/tag/download/release action.

# 2026-06-09 16:59 PDT - documented signing/notarization path correction

- Read the actual runbook `/Users/eric/wiki/infra/apple-notarization.md` and active scripts `panel/scripts/build-release-dmgs.sh`, `panel/scripts/notarize-release-dmgs.sh`, and `panel/scripts/verify-release-dmgs.sh`.
- Updated `.agents/RELEASE_BLOCKER_LEDGER_2026_06_09.md` and `.agents/PARALLEL_RELEASE_LANE_HANDOFF_2026_06_09.md` with the concrete keychain unlock/partition-list sequence, Developer ID/notary profile boundary, and canonical Sequoia/Tahoe build -> notarize/staple/blockmap -> verify flow.
- Boundary: no build, package, sign, notarize, tag, appcast, or download mutation was run. The known blocker is `prepackage_ready=false`, not missing knowledge of how to sign/notarize.

# 2026-06-10 - Gemma 4 12B JANG4M dev-app video proof

- Generated a tiny real video fixture with `ffmpeg`: 1-second 64x64 solid-red MP4, 1613 bytes.
- First real Electron dev-app Gemma video attempt at `max_prompt_tokens=4096` failed honestly: `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-gemma4-12b-jang4m-video-cache-20260610-proof.json`, `HTTP 413 prompt_too_long`, about `8315` prompt tokens.
- Reran with `max_prompt_tokens=12000`; tracked summary `build/current-real-ui-live-model-gemma4-12b-jang4m-video-proof-20260610.json` is `status=pass`; raw ignored proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-gemma4-12b-jang4m-video-cache-max12k-20260610-proof.json`.
- Proven: real Electron dev app, real loaded `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ-AI/gemma-4-12B-it-JANG_4M`, `video_url` attachment persisted, server decoded the base64 MP4, extracted frames, routed through MLLM media fallback, and assistant described a solid/dark red screen. Proof surfaces include `video_where_supported`, parser/language leak checks, cache endpoint stats, mixed-SWA native cache, L2 disk storage, and server cache controls.
- Cache/runtime evidence: `cache_detail=paged+mixed_swa`, `cached_tokens=20`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=84`, `disk_writes=2`; generic TurboQuant KV stayed inactive because Gemma mixed-SWA requires native RotatingKVCache metadata.
- Boundary: Gemma 12B JANG4M video is green only with adequate context cap for this fixture. Audio semantic E2E, installed-app parity, public tunnel SSE, package/sign/notarize/tag/upload remain open. No release action.

# 2026-06-10 - N2 JANGTQ2 dev-app Responses delta proof

- Ran a separate real Electron dev-app N2 JANGTQ2 Responses pass without built-in tools to isolate app renderer/content-delta streaming from the earlier built-in-tool loop.
- Tracked summary: `build/current-real-ui-live-model-n2-jangtq2-dev-app-delta-proof-20260610.json`, `status=pass`; raw ignored proof: `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-n2-jangtq2-responses-delta-only-20260610-proof.json`.
- Proven: current Electron dev build, real loaded `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/Nex-N2-Pro-JANGTQ2`, `/v1/responses`, two complete visible assistant turns, `responses_delta_streaming`, `responses_cache_detail_usage`, generation defaults, server cache controls, parser/language leak checks.
- Streaming evidence: `eventCounts.stream=45`; first assistant trace `count=21`, `N` -> `N2_APP_DELTA_ONE is ready. prefix cache, paged cache, and streaming delta are included.`; second assistant trace `count=24`, `N` -> `N2_APP_DELTA_TWO is ready. hybrid SSM, TurboQuant KV, and block disk L2 are included.`
- Cache/runtime evidence: native cache `hybrid_ssm_v1` / `hybrid_ssm_typed` with `attention_kv`, `ssm_companion_state`, and `async_rederive`; live attention TurboQuant KV only for attention layers; SSM companion native; second trace `cached_tokens=45`, `cache_detail=paged+ssm`; final L2 totals `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=120`, `l2_ssm_tokens_on_disk=274`, `l2_tokens_on_disk=394`.
- Boundary: this clears N2 dev-app content-delta transport. It does not prove built-in tools in this exact delta-only run, does not fix the earlier first post-tool visible answer collapse to `Created`, and does not clear installed-app/media/public tunnel/release gates. No package/sign/notarize/tag/download action.

# 2026-06-10 - MiMo JANG_2L app tool-choice boundary remains exactness-red

- Added scoped panel request behavior: when built-in tools are enabled and the latest user message explicitly names exactly one available tool, the panel sends a specific `tool_choice` for Chat Completions and Responses. It does not pin if no explicit tool name is present or if multiple tools are named.
- Added direct boundary probe `tests/cross_matrix/run_mimo_jang2l_chat_tool_boundary_probe.py`.
- Direct MiMo JANG_2L single-tool boundary passed: `build/current-mimo-v25-jang2l-chat-tool-boundary-20260610.json` shows auto and required `run_command` tool calls plus paged cache/L2 positive.
- Direct MiMo JANG_2L full-panel-tool boundary reproduced the app pressure: `build/current-mimo-v25-jang2l-chat-tool-boundary-fulltools-20260610.json` is red for auto (`HTTP 413` nonstream and stream `prompt_too_long`, 4754 tokenized prompt tokens vs max 4096) but green for specific/required `run_command`.
- Post-fix real Electron dev-app proof remains red: `build/current-real-ui-live-model-mimo-v25-jang2l-dev-app-after-toolchoice-proof-20260610.json`. The app loaded MiMo, executed `run_command`, streamed visible text, and proved paged cache/L2, but MiMo mutated requested semantics (`REAL_UI_LIVE_TOOL_ONE` to `REAL_UI_LAND_TOOL_ONE`, working-directory probe files to `/tmp/real_ui_land_tool_*.txt`). A stricter exact-command prompt also failed with partial/empty visible assistant content.
- Validation: `panel/tests/request-builder.test.ts` passed 68/68; focused request/model registry tests passed 8/8; `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false` passed; `python3 -m py_compile tests/cross_matrix/run_mimo_jang2l_chat_tool_boundary_probe.py` passed.
- Boundary: do not call MiMo JANG_2L app tool support green yet. Next work is tool-argument/exactness diagnosis, not cache/L2 or fake parser/tool-call synthesis. No package/sign/notarize/tag/download action.

# 2026-06-09 17:01 PDT - Gemma 4 12B MXFP4 source image proof

- Ran one live source media row: `.venv/bin/python tests/cross_matrix/run_gemma4_12b_media_smoke.py --rows mxfp4 --port 8892 --load-timeout 420 --out build/current-gemma4-12b-mxfp4-media-smoke-after-release-doc-correction-20260609.json`.
- Result: `status=pass`; `mxfp4_image` returned visible `Red`, `vision_advertised=true`, `red_detected=true`, `no_channel_leak=true`.
- Server log: `build/current-gemma4-12b-mxfp4-media-smoke-after-release-doc-correction-20260609_artifacts/mxfp4_image_server.log`; health records `weight_format=mxfp4`, `mlx_affine_quantized_matmul`, and `metal_na_active_on_host=true`.
- Boundary: source API image proof only. Does not clear Gemma tools/cache/UI/installed-app/tunnel/audio/video release rows. No package/sign/notarize/tag/download/release action.

# 2026-06-09 17:08 PDT - PyPI vmlx/jang checkpoint publish

- Published `jang==2.5.30` from `/Users/eric/jang/jang-tools`; PyPI URL: `https://pypi.org/project/jang/2.5.30/`.
- Published `vmlx==1.5.56` from the active worktree; PyPI URL: `https://pypi.org/project/vmlx/1.5.56/`.
- Source/package fix: bumped vMLX hard dependency and extras from `jang>=2.5.29` to `jang>=2.5.30`, and aligned `panel/scripts/bundle-python.sh`, `tests/test_engine_audit.py`, and `vmlx_engine/utils/jang_loader.py`.
- Build proof: fresh artifacts in `/tmp/vmlx-pypi-dist` and `/tmp/jang-pypi-dist`; `twine check` passed for both wheels and sdists.
- Publish proof: PyPI JSON reports `jang 2.5.30` and `vmlx 1.5.56` with both wheel and sdist files. Clean temp venv no-deps install succeeded for `jang==2.5.30 vmlx==1.5.56`; installed `vmlx` metadata requires `jang>=2.5.30`.
- Boundary: PyPI package checkpoint only. This is not a signed/notarized DMG release, and app release remains blocked by current prepackage/runtime/model/UI/cache rows.

# 2026-06-09 17:25 PDT - Qwen35 direct Responses SSE source-vs-tunnel proof

- Added `tests/cross_matrix/run_qwen35_responses_raw_sse_capture.py` and `tests/test_qwen35_responses_raw_sse_capture.py` to capture current-source Qwen35 MXFP8-MTP raw Responses SSE with reasoning enabled and required `record_fact`, then classify it beside the existing public tunnel capture.
- Live artifact: `build/current-responses-raw-sse-parity-qwen35-direct-source-vs-tunnel-20260609.json` is `status=fail`, with `missing_captures=["gateway"]`.
- Current-source direct proof is green for the reported failure class: same served model as tunnel (`models/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-MXFP8-CRACK-MTP`), authoritative args `{"value": "blue-cat"}`, reasoning events present, parse errors `0`, and valid output indices `message=[0]`, `function_call=[1]`.
- Tunnel remains red but narrower: it preserves args and reasoning events, but still emits `message=[0]` and `function_call=[0]`, so `conflicting_output_indices=[0]`.
- Health/runtime proof in the direct capture records native MTP active, hybrid SSM typed cache, TurboQuant attention KV enabled, and block disk cache writes. This is base Qwen35 MXFP8-MTP current-source proof; it does not clear Nex/N2 JANG_1L, MiMo, Gemma, UI, installed-app, or release rows.
- Next lane action: capture panel gateway with the exact same Qwen35 model/request. If gateway matches direct, rebuild/redeploy the tunnel backend from current source and recapture. If gateway/source duplicates `0`, reopen `stream_responses_api()` before any release claim. No parser fallback, reasoning disable, or fake argument injection.
- Boundary: no package, DMG build, signing, notarization, tag, appcast, upload, or public release action.

# 2026-06-09 17:35 PDT - Qwen35 gateway raw SSE and JANG Max2 sync audit

- Added gated live panel-gateway capture coverage in `panel/tests/api-gateway-qwen35-live-capture.test.ts`; `tests/cross_matrix/run_qwen35_responses_raw_sse_capture.py` now captures direct Qwen35 SSE and routes the same payload through the real `ApiGateway` class while the backend is live.
- Fixed the raw-SSE parity classifier to accept structured gateway logs with `containsReasoning=true` as no-reasoning-disable evidence. Root cause: the gateway live capture log is JSON, while the classifier previously only recognized Python server text logs.
- Live artifact: `build/current-responses-raw-sse-parity-qwen35-direct-gateway-source-vs-tunnel-20260609.json`, `status=fail`, `missing_captures=[]`.
- Direct and gateway are now green for the reported Responses failure class: both preserve `record_fact` args `{"value": "blue-cat"}`, have reasoning events, match `models/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-MXFP8-CRACK-MTP`, and emit valid indices `message=[0]`, `function_call=[1]`.
- Tunnel is the only remaining red surface: it preserves args/reasoning/model but emits `message=[0]`, `function_call=[0]`, so `conflicting_output_indices=[0]`.
- Checked JANG sync state locally and on `erics-m5-max2.local:~/jang`. Remote Max2 branch `codex/mimo-v25-cache-contract` has dirty JANG package/converter edits in `jang-tools/jang_tools/__main__.py`, `allocate.py`, `capabilities.py`, `convert.py`, and `convert_qwen35_jangtq.py`. They are package-side changes for MLP asymmetry floor control, `processor_config.json` preservation, Qwen35 JANGTQ MTP metadata stamping, and audio/video modality stamps.
- Packaging boundary: PyPI `jang` latest is already `2.5.30`. Do not overwrite it. If the Max2 JANG changes are accepted, land them in canonical `/Users/eric/jang/jang-tools`, bump to `2.5.31`, run build/twine check/install proof, publish, then bump vMLX dependency/extras and bundled Python.
- Boundary: no release/sign/notarize/tag/download action.

# 2026-06-10 - 128GB Gemma/MiMo/N2 live checkpoint proof

- Reduced blocker classes: `runtime/kernel`, `cache/storage`, and `api/ui` for the requested Gemma JANG/MXFP, MiMo JANG/JANGTQ, and Nex/N2 JANG/JANGTQ checkpoint rows.
- Handoff/proof matrix added: `.agents/PROOF_MATRIX_128GB_MIMO_N2_GEMMA_20260610.md`.
- Gemma 12B MXFP4/JANG4M: `build/current-gemma4-12b-mxfp4-jang4m-media-smoke-live-20260610.json` passed image/media for both rows; `build/current-gemma4-12b-mxfp4-jang4m-live-runtime-audit-20260610.json` passed conservative text, multiturn recall, reasoning-on answer, required tool, and cache endpoint sanity for both rows.
- MiMo JANGTQ2: `build/current-mimo-v25-jangtq2-live-cb-cache-text-20260610.json` passed load/cache plumbing on the 128GB host with mixed-SWA native cache, q8 storage boundary, paged cache, and block-disk L2; however text exactness is red (`ACK-CB-742` became `ACKCB-742`). Exactness probe `build/current-mimo-v25-jangtq2-exactness-variant-probe-live-20260610/result.json` remains open with exact string, JSON, and tool-arg mutations.
- MiMo JANG_2L: `build/current-mimo-v25-jang2l-live-cb-cache-text-20260610.json` passed. The 105 GiB local bundle loaded, used `mlx_affine_quantized_matmul`, final health showed about `104997.8 MB` active and `105956.2 MB` peak, exact `ACK-CB-742` was preserved, `cached_tokens=38` with `cache_detail=paged`, and L2 block writes were present (`l2_tokens_on_disk=62`).
- N2 JANGTQ2: `build/current-n2-jangtq2-live-chat-cache-responses-l2-20260610.json` passed. The 101 GiB bundle loaded and proved hybrid SSM cache (`hybrid_ssm_v1`), attention TurboQuant KV + native SSM companion, chat cache hit `paged+ssm`, required chat tool, Responses required tool, Responses tool-result continuation, Responses streaming tool args, and fresh-process L2 restore `paged+ssm+disk` with block disk and SSM companion disk hits.
- N2 JANG_1L: `build/current-n2-jang1l-live-chat-cache-responses-20260610.json` failed during `server_startup`. This was a real launch attempt with `--jang1l-required-extra-headroom-gib 1`, not a preflight skip. Server log shows qwen3_5_moe/JANG_1L route, 482 quant-shape patches, 123 shards, bfloat16 for 512 experts, wired limit set to the Metal cap (`115 GB`, model `119 GB` decimal), then `[METAL] Command buffer execution failed: Insufficient Memory` and exit `-6`.
- Boundary: checkpoint candidates are Gemma 12B MXFP4/JANG4M, MiMo JANG_2L, and N2 JANGTQ2. MiMo JANGTQ2 needs artifact/logit/decode exactness work. N2 JANG_1L needs a real 128GB loader/runtime memory strategy before any support claim. No package/sign/notarize/tag/download release action was run in this slice.

# 2026-06-10 - Gemma 12B JANG4M dev-app Responses/tools and image proof

- Added tracked summary `build/current-real-ui-live-model-gemma4-12b-jang4m-dev-app-proof-20260610.json` from two real Electron dev-app captures.
- Proven in app: Responses streaming + built-in tool loop + cache/L2 telemetry, and Chat Completions image attachment + red semantic answer.
- Updated `.agents/PROOF_MATRIX_128GB_MIMO_N2_GEMMA_20260610.md` with exact proven/not-proven boundaries.
- No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - N2 JANGTQ2 dev-app proof classified red

- Ran two real Electron dev-app N2 JANGTQ2 Responses/tool/cache attempts.
- Added tracked summary `build/current-real-ui-live-model-n2-jangtq2-dev-app-proof-20260610.json`, `status=fail`.
- Runtime/cache/tool pieces are positive: model loaded, hybrid SSM/TQ/L2 visible, built-in tools executed, no parser leak.
- Red surface is exact: `responses_delta_streaming` was not proven because first post-tool visible content collapsed to `Created`; compare raw server SSE with panel gateway/dev-app stream traces next.
- No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - N2 JANGTQ2 direct/gateway raw SSE delta proof

- Added and ran `tests/cross_matrix/run_n2_responses_stream_boundary_probe.py`.
- Artifact `build/current-n2-jangtq2-responses-stream-boundary-20260610.json` is `status=pass`.
- Direct and panel gateway raw SSE both prove N2 Responses tool-call args plus tool-result continuation content deltas.
- This narrows the remaining dev-app red row to renderer/chat tool-loop trace behavior, not server or gateway SSE transport.
- No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - MiMo JANG_2L dev-app proof classified red

- Ran real Electron dev-app MiMo V2.5 JANG_2L Chat/tools/cache proof.
- Added tracked summary `build/current-real-ui-live-model-mimo-v25-jang2l-dev-app-proof-20260610.json`, `status=fail`.
- Load/cache/L2 surfaces are positive; app tool loop and visible output are red.
- Next diagnostic is raw chat/tool output versus panel app trace, not cache/L2 work.
- No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - Gemma 12B JANG4M dev-app audio classified red

- Extended `panel/scripts/live-real-ui-model-proof.mjs` with a real audio attachment gate (`VMLINUX_REAL_UI_CHECK_AUDIO`) and strict semantic verification.
- Ran real Electron dev-app Gemma 12B JANG4M Chat Completions audio proof with a generated WAV saying `audio present`.
- Added tracked summary `build/current-real-ui-live-model-gemma4-12b-jang4m-audio-proof-20260610.json`, `status=fail`.
- Positive surfaces: app persisted `input_audio`, server decoded the base64 WAV, visible output streamed, server cache controls were verified, mixed-SWA cache hit/L2 were present (`cache_detail=paged+mixed_swa`, `cacheHitTokens=67`, `l2_tokens_on_disk=67`, `disk_writes=2`).
- Red surface: audio semantic verification failed; final text did not transcribe `audio present`.
- Boundary: not an attachment persistence or cache/L2 failure. Do not claim Gemma JANG4M audio support in a checkpoint release.

# 2026-06-10 - N2 JANGTQ2 dev-app Responses tool/cache/delta proof green

- Fixed the panel Responses in-turn tool-result follow-up path: `panel/src/main/ipc/chat.ts` now sends scoped `function_call_output` input with the latest `previous_response_id` and suppresses the original explicit tool choice on that follow-up.
- Ran real Electron dev-app N2 JANGTQ2 default Responses tool/cache proof after the fix.
- Added tracked summary `build/current-real-ui-live-model-n2-jangtq2-dev-app-prevresp-proof-20260610.json`, `status=pass`.
- Proven in the same app run: built-in `run_command`, tool-result continuation, visible `REAL_UI_LIVE_TOOL_ONE` and `REAL_UI_LIVE_TOOL_TWO`, renderer deltas (`count=8`, `count=15`), server cache controls, hybrid SSM cache, attention-only TurboQuant KV, block L2, and SSM disk.
- Raw proof logs the source fix path twice: `Responses tool follow-up using previous_response_id=... with 1 function_call_output item(s)`.
- Cache evidence: `cache_detail=paged+ssm`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=3579`, `l2_ssm_tokens_on_disk=17083`, `l2_tokens_on_disk=20662`, `block_disk_hits=110`, `ssm_disk_hits=1`.
- Boundary: stricter custom long-delta prompt remains red with repeated `!` output and missing second tool file; installed-app parity, N2 media, public tunnel parity, N2 JANG_1L, and release gates remain open.

# 2026-06-10 - MiMo JANG_2L dev-app Chat tool follow-up narrowed

- Fixed the panel Chat Completions follow-up path so the original explicit single-tool `tool_choice` is not forced again after an in-turn tool call has already executed.
- Ran real Electron dev-app MiMo V2.5 JANG_2L Chat/tools/cache proof after the follow-up change.
- Added tracked summary `build/current-real-ui-live-model-mimo-v25-jang2l-dev-app-followup-proof-20260610.json`, `status=fail`.
- Positive: no `tool_choice='required'` follow-up error, `persistedToolCount=135`, `eventCounts.stream=239`, `eventCounts.complete=2`, `cacheHitTokens=8072`, verified server cache controls, and `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=4580`.
- Red: MiMo still rewrote the requested `LIVE` sentinel/path into `LAND` and `/tmp`, so `long_tool_loop` remains red and expected probe files were not created.
- No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - N2 JANGTQ2 dev-app image/VL proof green

- Ran real Electron dev-app N2 JANGTQ2 Chat Completions image proof with server cache controls enabled and `max_prompt_tokens=12000`.
- Added tracked summary `build/current-real-ui-live-model-n2-jangtq2-image-proof-20260610.json`, `status=pass`.
- Proven in app: image attachment persisted, server `model_type=mllm`, one `image_url` reached `MEDIA_DIAG`, runtime processed `num_images_processed=1`, and final visible answer was `Red`.
- Runtime/cache: active about `103812.6 MB`, peak about `104874.6 MB`, hybrid SSM cache, attention-only TurboQuant KV, `cache_detail=paged+ssm`, `cached_tokens=18`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=50`, `l2_ssm_tokens_on_disk=68`, `l2_tokens_on_disk=118`.
- Boundary: audio/video/installed app/tunnel/N2 JANG_1L remain open. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - N2 JANGTQ2 dev-app video/VL proof green

- Generated `build/media-fixtures/red-64x64-1s.mp4` with `ffmpeg` and ran real Electron dev-app N2 JANGTQ2 Chat Completions video proof.
- Added tracked summary `build/current-real-ui-live-model-n2-jangtq2-video-proof-20260610.json`, `status=pass`.
- Proven in app: `video_url` persisted, server decoded the base64 MP4, extracted `4` frames from `25 total frames @ 25.0 fps`, processed `num_images_processed=4`, and final visible answer described a solid red screen.
- Runtime/cache: active about `103824.4 MB`, peak about `105305.7 MB`, hybrid SSM cache, attention-only TurboQuant KV, `cache_detail=paged+ssm`, `cached_tokens=18`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=50`, `l2_ssm_tokens_on_disk=68`, `l2_tokens_on_disk=118`.
- Boundary: audio/installed app/tunnel/N2 JANG_1L remain open. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - N2 JANGTQ2 dev-app audio gated

- Generated `build/media-fixtures/audio-present.wav` and ran real Electron dev-app N2 JANGTQ2 Chat Completions audio proof.
- Added tracked summary `build/current-real-ui-live-model-n2-jangtq2-audio-proof-20260610.json`, `status=fail`.
- Boundary proved: app attempted an audio turn and server saw `input_audio`, but `/v1/chat/completions` rejected it with `400` unsupported media modality; supported modalities reported by the server are `text, vision, video`.
- This is not a load/cache/L2 failure. Do not claim N2 audio support.
- No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - Gemma 12B QAT MXFP4 dev-app Responses/tools/cache proof green

- Ran real Electron dev-app Gemma 4 12B QAT MXFP4 Responses built-in tool/cache proof.
- Added tracked summary `build/current-real-ui-live-model-gemma4-12b-qat-mxfp4-dev-app-proof-20260610.json`, `status=pass`.
- Proven in app: built-in `run_command` loop, Responses tool-result continuation via `previous_response_id`, visible `REAL_UI_LIVE_TOOL_ONE` / `REAL_UI_LIVE_TOOL_TWO`, renderer deltas (`16`, `31`), MXFP4 affine matmul with Metal NA active, mixed-SWA cache, and block-disk L2.
- Cache evidence: `cache_detail=paged+mixed_swa`, `cache_hit_tokens=3538`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=3588`, `disk_hits=30`, `disk_writes=58`.
- Caveat: second visible answer starts with plain `thought`; leak gates passed, but keep visible-final style caveat open.
- Boundary: media/installed app/tunnel/release remain open. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - Gemma 12B QAT MXFP4 dev-app image/VL proof green

- Ran real Electron dev-app Gemma 4 12B QAT MXFP4 Chat Completions image proof.
- Added tracked summary `build/current-real-ui-live-model-gemma4-12b-qat-mxfp4-image-proof-20260610.json`, `status=pass`.
- Proven in app: image attachment persisted, server saw `image_url`, Gemma media fallback ran with `1 image(s)`, and final visible answer was `Red`.
- Runtime/cache: MXFP4 affine matmul with Metal NA active, mixed-SWA cache, `cache_detail=paged+mixed_swa`, `cached_tokens=20`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=64`, `disk_writes=2`.
- Boundary: video/audio/installed app/tunnel/release remain open. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - Gemma 12B QAT MXFP4 dev-app video/VL proof green

- Ran real Electron dev-app Gemma 4 12B QAT MXFP4 Chat Completions video proof.
- Added tracked summary `build/current-real-ui-live-model-gemma4-12b-qat-mxfp4-video-proof-20260610.json`, `status=pass`.
- Proven in app: `video_url` persisted, server decoded the base64 MP4, extracted `4` frames from `25 total frames @ 25.0 fps`, and final visible answer described a solid red screen.
- Runtime/cache: MXFP4 affine matmul with Metal NA active, mixed-SWA cache, `cache_detail=paged+mixed_swa`, `cached_tokens=20`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=65`, `disk_writes=2`.
- Boundary: audio/installed app/tunnel/release remain open. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - Gemma 12B QAT MXFP4 dev-app audio gated

- Ran real Electron dev-app Gemma 4 12B QAT MXFP4 Chat Completions audio proof.
- Added tracked summary `build/current-real-ui-live-model-gemma4-12b-qat-mxfp4-audio-proof-20260610.json`, `status=fail`.
- Boundary proved: app attempted an audio turn and server saw `input_audio`, but `/v1/chat/completions` rejected it with `400` unsupported media modality; supported modalities reported by the server are `text, vision, video`.
- This is not a load/cache/L2 failure. Do not claim Gemma MXFP4 audio support.
- No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - MiMo JANG_2L dev-app image/VL gated

- Ran real Electron dev-app MiMo V2.5 JANG_2L Chat Completions image proof with forced MLLM requested.
- Added tracked summary `build/current-real-ui-live-model-mimo-v25-jang2l-image-proof-20260610.json`, `status=fail`.
- Boundary proved: the 105 GiB artifact loaded and text/cache/L2 worked, but server `MEDIA_DIAG` saw `image_url` and then rejected image with `400` because the loaded runtime is text-only; supported modalities reported by the server are `text`.
- This is not a load/cache/L2 failure. Do not claim MiMo JANG_2L media support from preserved media weights.
- No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - MiMo JANG_2L dev-app Responses tools red

- Ran real Electron dev-app MiMo V2.5 JANG_2L Responses built-in tool proof.
- Added tracked summary `build/current-real-ui-live-model-mimo-v25-jang2l-responses-tools-proof-20260610.json`, `status=fail`.
- Positive evidence: first Responses turn emitted `run_command`, app used `previous_response_id` for the tool-result follow-up, and one tool loop completed.
- Red boundary: full two-turn loop failed with `CDP timeout: Runtime.evaluate` while the second request was still active; no final tool probe file semantics were verified.
- Cache/L2 remained real and positive: `cache_hit_tokens=1071`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=3784`, `disk_hits=18`, `disk_writes=60`.
- No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - Installed app runtime parity refreshed

- Ran installed-app runtime parity audit before rebuild: `build/current-installed-app-runtime-parity-audit-after-june10-devapp-proofs-20260610.json`, `status=open`; only stale file was `vmlx_engine/utils/jang_loader.py` in bundled Python and packaged source mirrors.
- Ran `panel/scripts/build-and-install.sh` to rebuild and locally install `/Applications/vMLX.app`.
- Reran audit: `build/current-installed-app-runtime-parity-audit-after-local-install-20260610.json`, `status=pass`, `missing_or_stale=[]`.
- Verified `/Applications/vMLX.app` with `codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=2`; valid on disk. This is local installed-app parity, not a signed/notarized DMG release.
- Regenerated `build/current-release-regression-manifest-after-local-installed-app-parity-20260610.json`; overall release manifest still fails (`prepackage_ready=false`, `release_ready=false`) while installed/staged app runtime parity components are green.

# 2026-06-10 - N2 JANGTQ2 installed-app live proof

- Ran real UI proof through `/Applications/vMLX.app` for `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/Nex-N2-Pro-JANGTQ2` with Responses, built-in tools, cache controls, `--is-mllm`, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, and max tokens `128`.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-installed-app-n2-jangtq2-responses-tools-cache-20260610.json` is `status=pass`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-installed-app-n2-jangtq2-responses-tools-cache-20260610-proof.json`.
- Proven surfaces: installed-app UI, visible two-turn Responses output, two `run_command` tool calls, tool-result continuation, content deltas, server cache controls, parser/reasoning leak checks, `hybrid_ssm_v1`, attention-only TurboQuant KV storage-boundary cache, native SSM companion state, block L2, and SSM disk restore hit.
- Boundary: no public tunnel proof, no N2 audio support, no N2 JANG_1L clearance, no stricter prompt-quality clearance, and no package/sign/notarize/tag/upload/release action.

# 2026-06-10 - Gemma 12B MXFP4 installed-app live proof

- Ran real UI proof through `/Applications/vMLX.app` for `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ-AI/gemma-4-12B-it-qat-MXFP4` with Responses, built-in tools, cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, and max tokens `128`.

# 2026-06-10 - N2 JANGTQ2 installed-app audio gated

- Ran real UI audio proof through `/Applications/vMLX.app` for `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/Nex-N2-Pro-JANGTQ2` with Chat Completions, cache controls, `--is-mllm`, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, and max tokens `96`.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-installed-app-n2-jangtq2-audio-proof-20260610.json` is `status=fail`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-installed-app-n2-jangtq2-audio-20260610-proof.json`.
- Boundary proved: installed-app UI launched, text chat worked first, the app attached one audio file, server `MEDIA_DIAG` saw `input_audio`, and `/v1/chat/completions` rejected it with `400` unsupported media modality. Supported modalities reported by the server are `text, vision, video`.
- Runtime/cache stayed live before the gate: `hybrid_ssm_v1`, attention-only TurboQuant KV, paged+SSM cache, block L2, and SSM companion disk stores.
- This is not a load/cache/L2 failure. Do not claim N2 installed-app audio support. No package/sign/notarize/tag/upload/release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - Gemma 12B MXFP4 installed-app audio gated

- Ran real UI audio proof through `/Applications/vMLX.app` for `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ-AI/gemma-4-12B-it-qat-MXFP4` with Chat Completions, cache controls, `--is-mllm`, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, and max tokens `96`.

- Boundary proved: installed-app UI launched, text chat worked first, the app attached one audio file, server `MEDIA_DIAG` saw `input_audio`, and `/v1/chat/completions` rejected it with `400` unsupported media modality. Supported modalities reported by the server are `text, vision, video`.
- Runtime/cache stayed live before the gate: MXFP4 affine matmul with Metal NA active, `mixed_swa_kv_v1`, generic TurboQuant KV correctly disabled, paged mixed-SWA cache, and block L2 writes.
- This is not a load/cache/L2 failure. Do not claim Gemma installed-app audio support. No package/sign/notarize/tag/upload/release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - N2 JANG_1L override and MiMo installed-app text/cache

- Refreshed no-load Nex/N2 Pro JANG_1L memory preflight before launch. Artifact `build/current-n2-pro-jang1l-local-memory-preflight-20260610-after-installed-app-proofs.json` is `status=open`, `decision=do_not_launch`, payload `110.57 GiB`, required available `118.57 GiB`, observed available `112.77 GiB`, gap `5.8 GiB`.
- Eric explicitly overrode the JANG_1L launch-safe gate. Override launch artifact `build/current-n2-jang1l-live-chat-cache-override-20260610.json` is `status=fail`, `phase=server_startup`; server log again ends with Metal OOM after `Wired limit set to 115 GB (model 119 GB)`.
- Ran installed-app MiMo JANG_2L text/cache proof through `/Applications/vMLX.app` with Chat Completions, no tools, no media, cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, and max tokens `96`.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-installed-app-mimo-v25-jang2l-text-cache-proof-20260610.json` is `status=pass`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-installed-app-mimo-v25-jang2l-text-cache-20260610-proof.json`.
- Proven: installed-app UI, real 105 GiB MiMo JANG_2L load, exact visible text turns `MIMO_INSTALLED_TEXT_ONE` and `MIMO_INSTALLED_TEXT_TWO`, generation defaults, no parser/reasoning leak, native `mixed_swa_kv_v1` / `mimo_v2_asymmetric_swa`, paged cache hit, and block L2 writes.
- Boundary: MiMo installed-app tools/media/JANGTQ exactness/speed remain open. N2 JANG_1L remains red and needs a real lower-peak runtime strategy. No package/sign/notarize/tag/upload/release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - MiMo JANG_2L installed-app tools red

- Ran installed-app MiMo JANG_2L built-in tool proof through `/Applications/vMLX.app` with Chat Completions, built-in tools, cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, and max tokens `256`.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-installed-app-mimo-v25-jang2l-tools-proof-20260610.json` is `status=fail`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-installed-app-mimo-v25-jang2l-tools-20260610-proof.json`.
- Positive evidence: the installed app reached the real tool surface and executed one `run_command`, creating `real_ui_tool_probe_2.txt` with `REAL_UI_LIVE_TOOL_TWO`.
- Red evidence: no `long_tool_loop` surface; first-turn marker mutated to `REAL_UI_LAND_TOOL_ONE`, expected first probe file was missing, and visible content became repetitive tool-planning prose.
- Cache/L2 stayed strong: `cache_detail=paged`, `cache_hit_tokens=4552`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=4720`. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - MiMo JANG_2L installed-app image gated

- Ran installed-app MiMo JANG_2L image proof through `/Applications/vMLX.app` with Chat Completions, forced MLLM requested, cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, and max tokens `96`.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-installed-app-mimo-v25-jang2l-image-proof-20260610.json` is `status=fail`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-installed-app-mimo-v25-jang2l-image-20260610-proof.json`.
- Boundary proved: installed app attached one image and server `MEDIA_DIAG` saw `image_url`, but `/v1/chat/completions` rejected image with `400` because the loaded runtime is text-only. Supported modalities reported by the server are `text`.
- Runtime/cache stayed live before the gate: `mixed_swa_kv_v1`, `mimo_v2_asymmetric_swa`, `cache_detail=paged`, `cached_tokens=39`, and `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=110`.
- This is not a load/cache/L2 failure and not a lost attachment. Do not claim MiMo installed-app media support. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - N2 JANG_1L launch-safe gate

- Reran the no-load Nex/N2 Pro JANG_1L preflight and the launch-safe chat/cache gate after the MiMo installed-app image classification.
- Preflight artifact `build/current-n2-pro-jang1l-local-memory-preflight-launch-safe-20260610.json` is `status=open`, `decision=do_not_launch`: payload `110.57 GiB`, required available `118.57 GiB`, observed available `114.23 GiB`, gap `4.34 GiB`.
- Chat/cache gate artifact `build/current-n2-jang1l-chat-cache-launch-safe-20260610.json` is `status=skipped`, `reason=n2_jang1l_insufficient_available_memory`: observed available `114.22 GiB`, gap `4.35 GiB`.
- Requested tool, Responses, Responses stream, and L2 restart probes were recorded, but the safe gate correctly skipped before launching the server.
- Boundary: no new Metal OOM and no runtime clearance. The earlier override launch already proved forced below-gate startup aborts before health; current safe path remains queued until memory is high enough or a lower-peak JANG_1L loader/runtime path exists.

# 2026-06-10 - MiMo JANGTQ_2 installed-app text/cache

- Ran installed-app MiMo JANGTQ_2 short text/cache proof through `/Applications/vMLX.app` with Chat Completions, no tools, no media, cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, and max tokens `64`.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-installed-app-mimo-v25-jangtq2-text-cache-proof-20260610.json` is `status=pass`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-installed-app-mimo-v25-jangtq2-text-cache-20260610-proof.json`.
- Proven: installed-app UI, real 79 GiB MiMo JANGTQ_2 load, exact visible text turns `MIMO_JANGTQ2_TEXT_ONE` and `MIMO_JANGTQ2_TEXT_TWO`, generation defaults, no parser/reasoning leak, native `mixed_swa_kv_v1` / `mimo_v2_asymmetric_swa`, paged cache hit, and block L2 writes.
- Runtime/cache evidence: active memory `76484.8 MB`, peak `77037.2 MB`, cache hit tokens `42`, `cache_detail=paged`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=120`, and block-disk writes `3`.
- Boundary: short installed-app text/cache is green, but broader MiMo JANGTQ_2 exactness/tool/media/source-vs-quant rows remain open. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - MiMo JANGTQ_2 installed-app image gated

- Ran installed-app MiMo JANGTQ_2 image proof through `/Applications/vMLX.app` with Chat Completions, forced MLLM requested, cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, and max tokens `64`.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-installed-app-mimo-v25-jangtq2-image-proof-20260610.json` is `status=fail`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-installed-app-mimo-v25-jangtq2-image-20260610-proof.json`.
- Boundary proved: installed app attached one image and server `MEDIA_DIAG` saw `image_url`, but `/v1/chat/completions` rejected image with `400` because the loaded runtime is text-only. Supported modalities reported by the server are `text`.
- Runtime/cache stayed live before the gate: `mixed_swa_kv_v1`, `mimo_v2_asymmetric_swa`, `cache_detail=paged`, `cache_hit_tokens=39`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=132`, and block-disk writes `3`.
- This is not a load/cache/L2 failure and not a lost attachment. Do not claim MiMo JANGTQ_2 installed-app media support. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - Gemma 12B JANG4M installed-app Responses/tools/cache

- Ran installed-app Gemma 12B JANG4M Responses/tool/cache proof through `/Applications/vMLX.app` with built-in tools, cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, and max tokens `128`.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-installed-app-gemma4-12b-jang4m-responses-tools-cache-20260610.json` is `status=pass`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-installed-app-gemma4-12b-jang4m-responses-tools-cache-20260610-proof.json`.
- Proven: installed-app UI, real `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ-AI/gemma-4-12B-it-JANG_4M` load, `/v1/responses`, two built-in `run_command` calls, `previous_response_id` tool-result continuations, visible assistant turns, content/tool deltas, server cache controls, no parser/reasoning leak, native mixed-SWA cache, and block L2.
- Runtime/cache evidence: active memory `9889.4 MB`, peak `12630.4 MB`, JANG affine matmul with Metal NA active, `cache_detail=paged+mixed_swa`, `cache_hit_tokens=3538`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=3571`, block-disk hits `30`, and block-disk writes `58`.
- Boundary: installed-app JANG4M image/video/audio, larger Gemma QAT rows, tunnel SSE, and release readiness remain open. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - Gemma 12B JANG4M installed-app image/VL

- Ran installed-app Gemma 12B JANG4M image proof through `/Applications/vMLX.app` with Chat Completions, forced media, cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, and max tokens `96`.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-installed-app-gemma4-12b-jang4m-image-proof-20260610.json` is `status=pass`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-installed-app-gemma4-12b-jang4m-image-20260610-proof.json`.
- Proven: installed-app UI, real `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ-AI/gemma-4-12B-it-JANG_4M` load, two visible text turns before media, image attachment persistence, Gemma media fallback with `1 image(s)`, visible answer `Red`, server cache controls, no parser/reasoning leak, native mixed-SWA cache, and block L2.
- Runtime/cache evidence: active memory `9892.5 MB`, peak `10450.3 MB`, JANG affine matmul with Metal NA active, `cache_detail=paged+mixed_swa`, `cache_hit_tokens=20`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=77`, and block-disk writes `2`.
- Boundary: installed-app JANG4M video/audio, larger Gemma QAT rows, tunnel SSE, and release readiness remain open. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - N2 JANG_1L high-free live launch

- Reran no-load Nex/N2 Pro JANG_1L preflight at `build/current-n2-pro-jang1l-local-memory-preflight-ultrafree-20260610.json`: indexed payload `110.57 GiB`, required available `118.57 GiB`, observed available `114.09 GiB`, gap `4.48 GiB`, strict decision `do_not_launch`.
- Per Eric's instruction to launch one-at-a-time anyway, ran `build/current-n2-jang1l-live-chat-cache-ultrafree-20260610.json` with lowered JANG_1L headroom (`3 GiB`), max output `16`, server max tokens `256`, prefill batch `64`, prefill step `128`, completion batch `32`, SSM cache `128 MB`, paged cache block size `64`, max cache blocks `256`, block L2 `2 GB`, plus tool, Responses, Responses stream, and L2 restart probes requested.
- Result: `status=fail`, `phase=server_startup`, server exit `-6`; no health or request probe was reached.
- Server log proves this was a real launch: qwen3_5_moe/JANG_1L route, qwen tool parser, qwen3 reasoning parser, hybrid cache, attention-only TurboQuant KV with native SSM companion state, mmap JANG loader, `482` quant-shape patches, `123` shards, bfloat16 for `512` experts, `Wired limit set to 115 GB (model 119 GB)`, then `[METAL] Command buffer execution failed: Insufficient Memory`.
- Boundary: N2 JANG_1L is still red on this 128 GiB host until a lower-peak loader/runtime path exists. Do not claim release support from another threshold reduction; N2 JANGTQ2 remains the N2 checkpoint candidate.

# 2026-06-10 - Gemma 12B JANG4M installed-app video/VL

- Ran installed-app Gemma 12B JANG4M video proof through `/Applications/vMLX.app` with Chat Completions, forced video, cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, max tokens `96`, and explicit max prompt tokens `12000`.

- Proven: installed-app UI, real `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ-AI/gemma-4-12B-it-JANG_4M` load, two visible text turns before media, video attachment persistence, server `MEDIA_DIAG` video detection, base64 MP4 decode, `4` extracted frames from the 25 fps fixture, visible answer `The video shows a solid, static red screen with no movement or changes.`, server cache controls, no parser/reasoning leak, native mixed-SWA cache, and block L2.
- Runtime/cache evidence: active memory `9890 MB`, peak `10430.4 MB`, JANG affine matmul with Metal NA active, `cache_detail=paged+mixed_swa`, `cache_hit_tokens=20`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=77`, and block-disk writes `2`.
- Boundary: installed-app JANG4M audio, default-4k video, larger Gemma QAT rows, tunnel SSE, and release readiness remain open. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - Gemma 12B JANG4M installed-app audio red

- Ran installed-app Gemma 12B JANG4M audio proof through `/Applications/vMLX.app` with Chat Completions, forced audio, cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, max tokens `96`, and the `audio-present.wav` fixture.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-installed-app-gemma4-12b-jang4m-audio-proof-20260610.json` is `status=fail`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-installed-app-gemma4-12b-jang4m-audio-20260610-proof.json`.
- Positive evidence: installed-app UI, real `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ-AI/gemma-4-12B-it-JANG_4M` load, two visible text turns before audio, audio attachment persistence, server `MEDIA_DIAG` input_audio detection, base64 WAV decode, server cache controls, no parser/reasoning leak, native mixed-SWA cache, and block L2 before the media turn.
- Red evidence: final audio turn had empty visible assistant content, `visibleAssistantTurnsComplete=false`, `audioSemanticVerified=false`, and no `audio_where_supported` surface.
- Boundary: JANG4M installed-app audio is red. Do not claim audio support; text/tools/image/video rows remain separately green. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - MiMo JANGTQ_2 installed-app tools

- Ran installed-app MiMo V2.5 JANGTQ_2 built-in tool proof through `/Applications/vMLX.app` with Chat Completions, built-in tools, cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, and max tokens `256`.

- Proven: installed-app UI, real `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/MiMo-V2.5-JANGTQ_2` load, built-in `run_command` loop, exact probe files `REAL_UI_LIVE_TOOL_ONE` and `REAL_UI_LIVE_TOOL_TWO`, visible assistant turns, server cache controls, no parser/reasoning leak, native mixed-SWA cache, and block L2.
- Runtime/cache evidence: active memory `76763.1 MB`, peak `81328.7 MB`, TurboQuant codebook routed experts with prestacked layout, `cache_detail=paged`, `cache_hit_tokens=4548`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=4225`, block-disk hits `36`, and block-disk writes `68`.
- Boundary: this clears the default installed-app Chat Completions tool loop for MiMo JANGTQ_2 only. Broader exactness/source-vs-quant, Responses tools, media, JANG_2L tools, and release readiness remain open. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - MiMo JANGTQ_2 installed-app Responses tools

- Ran installed-app MiMo V2.5 JANGTQ_2 Responses built-in tool proof through `/Applications/vMLX.app` with built-in tools, cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, and max tokens `256`.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-installed-app-mimo-v25-jangtq2-responses-tools-proof-20260610.json` is `status=pass`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-installed-app-mimo-v25-jangtq2-responses-tools-20260610-proof.json`.

- Runtime/cache evidence: active memory `76763.1 MB`, peak `81328.7 MB`, TurboQuant codebook routed experts with prestacked layout, `cache_detail=paged`, `cache_hit_tokens=4548`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=4225`, block-disk hits `36`, and block-disk writes `68`.
- Boundary: this clears the default installed-app Responses tool loop for MiMo JANGTQ_2 only. Broader literal/JSON/source-vs-quant exactness, media, JANG_2L tools, and release readiness remain open. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - Gemma 31B JANG4M dev-app video/VL

- Ran current Electron dev-build Gemma 4 31B QAT JANG4M video/VL proof with `npm run dev`, Chat Completions, one app video attachment, server cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, max tokens `128`, and max prompt tokens `12000`.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-dev-app-gemma4-31b-jang4m-video-proof-20260610.json` is `status=pass`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-dev-app-gemma4-31b-jang4m-video-20260610-proof.json`.
- Proven: dev app launched, real `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ-AI/gemma-4-31B-it-qat-JANG_4M` loaded, two visible text turns completed before media, the app persisted one `video_url` attachment, server `MEDIA_DIAG` saw `video_url`, the server decoded the base64 MP4, extracted `4` frames, routed those frames through the Gemma media fallback, and the assistant answered `The provided image is a solid red square.`; `videoSemanticVerified=true`.
- Runtime/cache evidence: active memory `25842.8 MB`, peak `26233.1 MB`, `weight_format=jang_affine`, `profile=JANG_4M`, Metal NA active, native `mixed_swa_kv_v1`, `cache_detail=paged+mixed_swa`, `cache_hit_tokens=20`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=62`, `l2_tokens_on_disk=62`, block-disk writes `2`, and video-turn media-prefix cache stored `355` prompt tokens.
- Boundary: this clears Gemma 31B JANG4M current dev-build video/VL only with explicit `max_prompt_tokens=12000`. The final wording calls the extracted frame an image while still verifying the solid-red video content. It does not clear default-4k video behavior, 31B audio, installed-app parity, public tunnel SSE, package/sign/notarize/tag/upload, or release readiness. No release action was run.

- Ran current Electron dev-build Gemma 4 26B A4B QAT JANG4M video/VL proof with `npm run dev`, Chat Completions, one app video attachment, server cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, max tokens `128`, and max prompt tokens `12000`.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-dev-app-gemma4-26b-jang4m-video-proof-20260610.json` is `status=pass`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-dev-app-gemma4-26b-jang4m-video-20260610-proof.json`.
- Proven: dev app launched, real `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ-AI/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-qat-JANG_4M` loaded, two visible text turns completed before media, the app persisted one `video_url` attachment, server `MEDIA_DIAG` saw `video_url`, the server decoded the base64 MP4, extracted `4` frames, routed those frames through the Gemma media fallback, and the assistant answered `The video is a solid, static red square. REAL_UI_LIVE.`; `videoSemanticVerified=true`.
- Runtime/cache evidence: active memory `17779.1 MB`, peak `18557.2 MB`, `weight_format=jang_affine`, `profile=JANG_4M`, native `mixed_swa_kv_v1`, `cache_detail=paged+mixed_swa`, `cache_hit_tokens=20`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=64`, `l2_tokens_on_disk=64`, block-disk writes `2`, and video-turn media-prefix cache stored `357` prompt tokens.
- Boundary: this clears Gemma 26B JANG4M current dev-build video/VL only with explicit `max_prompt_tokens=12000`. It does not clear default-4k video behavior, 26B audio, installed-app parity, public tunnel SSE, package/sign/notarize/tag/upload, or release readiness. No release action was run.

- Ran installed-app MiMo V2.5 JANGTQ_2 exact-output proof through `/Applications/vMLX.app` with Chat Completions, no tools, no media, cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, and max tokens `64`.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-installed-app-mimo-v25-jangtq2-exact-output-proof-20260610.json` is `status=fail`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-installed-app-mimo-v25-jangtq2-exact-output-20260610-proof.json`.
- Positive evidence: installed-app UI, real `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/MiMo-V2.5-JANGTQ_2` load, visible streamed Chat turns, server cache controls, no parser/reasoning leak, no persisted tools/reasoning, native mixed-SWA cache, paged prefix hit, and block L2 writes.
- Runtime/cache evidence: active memory `76483.5 MB`, peak `77024.8 MB`, TurboQuant codebook routed experts with prestacked layout, `cache_detail=paged`, `cache_hit_tokens=41`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=117`, and block-disk writes `3`.
- Red evidence: expected `ACK-CB-742` but got `ACKCB-742`; expected `{"status":"ok","value":"blue-cat"}` but got `{"`. Boundary: exact literal/JSON output remains red for MiMo JANGTQ_2 and should stay assigned to artifact/logit/quant/decode diagnosis, not parser/cache work. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - N2 JANG_1L after-MiMo launch-safe refresh

- Reran no-load Nex/N2 Pro JANG_1L preflight after the MiMo exact-output proof.
- Preflight artifact `build/current-n2-pro-jang1l-local-memory-preflight-after-mimo-exact-20260610.json` is `status=open`, `decision=do_not_launch`: indexed payload `110.57 GiB`, required available `118.57 GiB`, observed available `113.29 GiB`, gap `5.28 GiB`.
- Ran the launch-safe chat/cache gate with tool, Responses, Responses stream, and L2 restart probes requested. Artifact `build/current-n2-jang1l-chat-cache-after-mimo-exact-20260610.json` is `status=skipped`, `reason=n2_jang1l_insufficient_available_memory`: observed available `113.28 GiB`, gap `5.29 GiB`.
- No weights were loaded and `build/current-n2-jang1l-after-mimo-exact-20260610-block-cache` stayed empty.
- Boundary: current headroom still does not clear N2 JANG_1L. The correct release split remains N2 JANGTQ2 as checkpoint candidate, JANG_1L red until a lower-peak runtime/loader path or sufficient current headroom exists. No release action was run.

- Runtime/cache evidence: active memory `76763.1 MB`, peak `81328.7 MB`, TurboQuant codebook routed experts with prestacked layout, native `mixed_swa_kv_v1` / `mimo_v2_asymmetric_swa`, `cache_detail=paged`, `cache_hit_tokens=4548`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=4225`, block-disk hits `36`, and block-disk writes `68`.
- Boundary: this clears dev-app Responses/tool/cache parity for MiMo JANGTQ_2 only. It does not clear MiMo JANGTQ_2 exact literal/JSON/source-vs-quant rows or media support. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - MiMo JANGTQ_2 dev-app exact output

- Ran current Electron dev-build MiMo V2.5 JANGTQ_2 exact-output proof with `npm run dev`, Chat Completions, no tools, server cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, and max tokens `64`.

- Red evidence: expected `ACK-CB-742` but got `ACKCB-742`; expected `{"status":"ok","value":"blue-cat"}` but got `{"`. Boundary: the same exactness failure reproduces in dev app and installed app. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - N2 JANGTQ2 dev-app exact output

- Ran current Electron dev-build Nex/N2 Pro JANGTQ2 exact-output proof with `npm run dev`, Chat Completions, no tools, server cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, and max tokens `64`.

- Boundary: this clears N2 JANGTQ2 dev-app exact text/JSON only. N2 JANG_1L, audio, public tunnel SSE parity, stricter custom long-delta prompt quality, and release readiness remain open. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - Gemma 12B MXFP4 dev-app exact output

- Boundary: this clears Gemma 12B QAT MXFP4 dev-app exact text/JSON only. Gemma audio, larger Gemma QAT rows, public tunnel SSE parity, and release readiness remain open. No release action was run.

# 2026-06-10 - Gemma 12B JANG4M dev-app exact output

# 2026-06-10 - N2 JANG_1L deferred startup eval

- Fixed the prior N2 JANG_1L pre-health Metal OOM class by adding a narrow loader policy in `vmlx_engine/utils/tokenizer.py`: qwen3_5_moe affine `JANG_1L` now calls `load_jang_model(..., skip_eval=True)` so startup does not eagerly materialize every parameter. Ordinary JANG and JANGTQ rows are not affected.
- Proof summary `build/current-n2-jang1l-deferred-eval-startup-proof-20260610.json` is `status=open`; live artifact is `build/current-n2-jang1l-live-chat-cache-deferred-eval-live-attempt-20260610.json`.
- Proven: with `114.04 GiB` available and 3 GiB lower-peak headroom, the real `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/Nex-N2-Pro-JANG_1L` server reached `/health`, loaded in `6.7s`, selected qwen3_5_moe, qwen tools, qwen3 reasoning, hybrid cache, attention TurboQuant KV plus native SSM companion, initialized paged/block-L2/SSM companion L2, and completed one bounded Chat Completions request with HTTP `200`.
- Still red: after the first request, active Metal working-set pressure hit `102%` of the `107.5GB` cap; cache warm/hit, tool, Responses, Responses stream, and full L2 restart probes did not pass. Raising `VMLINUX_METAL_WS_REJECT_PCT=104` with wired-limit setup reproduced a first-request Metal OOM (`server_exit=-6`), so do not bypass the guard as a release fix.
- Boundary: this is a real startup/first-chat fix, not N2 JANG_1L release clearance. N2 JANGTQ2 remains the N2 checkpoint candidate until JANG_1L gets a second lower-peak request/cache strategy.

# 2026-06-10 - MiMo JANGTQ_2 dev-app image/VL red

- Ran current Electron dev-build MiMo V2.5 JANGTQ_2 image proof with `npm run dev`, Chat Completions, forced MLLM, one image attachment, server cache controls, temperature `0`, top_p `1`, and max tokens `96`.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-dev-app-mimo-v25-jangtq2-image-proof-20260610.json` is `status=fail`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-dev-app-mimo-v25-jangtq2-image-proof-20260610-proof.json`.
- Positive evidence: dev app launched, real `/Users/eric/.mlxstudio/models/JANGQ-AI/MiMo-V2.5-JANGTQ_2` loaded, two visible text turns completed before media, server `MEDIA_DIAG` saw one `image_url`, no parser/reasoning leak was recorded, server cache controls were visible, and generation defaults were applied.
- Runtime/cache evidence before the media guard: active memory `76491.8 MB`, peak `77127.2 MB`, TurboQuant codebook routed experts, prestacked layout, native `mixed_swa_kv_v1` / `mimo_v2_asymmetric_swa`, `cache_detail=paged`, `cache_hit_tokens=39`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=132`, and block-disk writes `3`.
- Red evidence: image turn returned HTTP `400`: `/v1/chat/completions received unsupported media modality image because the loaded runtime is text-only. Supported modalities: text.` Server log says MiMo V2 preserved media weights override forced MLLM because bundle metadata marks vision/audio as `unwired weights_preserved_text_runtime`. Do not claim MiMo JANGTQ_2 image/VL support.

- First attempt before the rerun was an environment/interpreter failure (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'uvicorn'`) and was not treated as model evidence.
- Live proof: `build/current-mimo-v25-jang2l-restart-l2-restore-20260610-rerun/summary.json` is `status=pass`; per-model result is `build/current-mimo-v25-jang2l-restart-l2-restore-20260610-rerun/MiMo-V2.5-JANG_2L/result.json`.
- Proven cache surface: first process wrote one block / `48` tokens to block-disk L2; second process opened the existing store and served HTTP `200` with `48` cached tokens, `cache_detail=paged+disk`, block disk `disk_hits=1`, scheduler cache `disk_hits=1`, and `reconstruction_ok=true`.
- Runtime evidence: JANG v2 mmap load, `103` safetensors shards, wired limit `115 GB`, active Metal baseline about `102.5 GB`, native `mixed_swa_kv_v1` / `mimo_v2_asymmetric_swa`, and generic TurboQuant KV intentionally inactive for MiMo.
- Boundary: this clears MiMo JANG_2L source fresh-process block-disk L2 restore only. Visible exact `ACK` remains `output_status=review`; MiMo JANG_2L tool-loop, Responses semantics, media, installed-app parity, public tunnel SSE, package/sign/notarize/tag/upload, and release readiness remain open.

# 2026-06-10 - MiMo JANG_2L dev-app Responses tools rerun

- Reran the current Electron dev-app MiMo V2.5 JANG_2L Responses built-in tool proof on HEAD `47b4ad66` with `/v1/responses`, built-in tools, cache controls, thinking off, `temperature=0`, `top_p=1`, `max_tokens=384`, and `max_prompt_tokens=12000`.
- Proof summary `build/current-real-ui-live-model-mimo-v25-jang2l-responses-tools-rerun-20260610.json` is `status=fail`; raw proof is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-mimo-v25-jang2l-responses-tools-rerun-20260610-proof.json`; screenshot is `docs/internal/agent-notes/current-real-ui-live-model-mimo-v25-jang2l-responses-tools-rerun-20260610-chat.png`.
- Positive evidence: the older CDP-timeout ambiguity is gone. The real dev app completed two visible assistant turns, used `/v1/responses`, emitted Responses deltas, used `previous_response_id` for tool-result follow-up, persisted settings, applied generation defaults, and recorded server cache-control surfaces.
- Runtime/cache evidence: active memory `105485.6 MB`, peak `110316.4 MB`, native `mixed_swa_kv_v1` / `mimo_v2_asymmetric_swa`, generic TurboQuant KV inactive, `cache_hit_tokens=4552`, last cache hit `paged` / `3481` tokens / `reconstruction_ok=true`, `l2_block_tokens_on_disk=4960`, block disk `disk_hits=36`, `disk_writes=80`, and block-disk size `1.487 GB`.
- Red evidence: release assertion failed because the proof did not record `long_tool_loop`. Visible/tool semantics drifted: the first assistant content changed `REAL_UI_LIVE_TOOL_ONE` to `REAL_UI_LAND_TOOL_ONE`, the second assistant was only `The command executed successfully. The file`, and tool/file semantics did not satisfy the proof contract.
- Boundary: this does not clear MiMo JANG_2L Responses/tool support for release. Cache/L2/Responses transport is not the current blocker; tool semantic drift remains the blocker. No release/sign/notarize/package/tag/upload action was run.
